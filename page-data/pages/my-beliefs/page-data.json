The Father, The Son, and the Holy\nSpirit. God is the creator of heaven and earth. Thus He is the almighty Father in both\nheaven and earth. He is Omniscient. He is Holy. He is Just and righteous. He is truth.\nHe is freedom. He is omnipresent. He is eternal. He is immuatable. He is full of mercy\nand grace. He is love and He is sovereign in all He does. </p>\n<h2 id=\"word-of-god\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#word-of-god\" aria-label=\"word of god permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Word of God</h2>\n<p>I believe the Bible is the inspired word by God. The Bible is God breathed and it is living\n(Timothy 3:16). I also believe the Bible is fully true and error free and it is a basis for us\non how to live. It’s also one our main weapons in fighting the enemy. It is also also\nknown as the sword of the spirit. It is the most essential part of the armor of God. Finally\nI believe the theme of the bible is God’s redemption of man.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jesus-christ\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#jesus-christ\" aria-label=\"jesus christ permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Jesus Christ</h2>\n<p>I believe that Jesus Christ is God and that he pre-existed as God in all glory in the\ncreation of Heaven and earth. I believe in the virgin birth and that Jesus entered the World through the womb of\nthe Virgin Mary. </p>\n<p>I believe that is when the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Jesus lived a\npure sinless live. I believe that he voluntarily died on the cross for our sins. Meaning, he\ntook the place of us so we can be saved from the penalty of sin (Romans 6:23). Instead\nof us dying, He died for us. I believe that he conquered death and sin (Romans 6:8-10)\nby rising from the dead three days later. Jesus then went to heaven where He is exalted\nand seated at the right hand of the Father. </p>\n<p>Finally I believe He will come back to earth in the second coming\nwhere He will reign and have judgment on the living and the dead. Jesus paid the\nultimate sacrifice for us. A debt he didn’t have to pay. A debt we can never pay back.\nThis is why I am so thankful for what He did for us. Without His sacrifice we cannot be\nset free from sin. Without his sacrifice there is no chance for salvation or to be filled with\nthe Holy Spirit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"holy-spirit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#holy-spirit\" aria-label=\"holy spirit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Holy Spirit</h2>\n<p>As for the Holy Spirit, I believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person in the Godhead.\nThe Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian (1 Corinthians 3:16). I believe the job of the\nHoly Spirit is to convict us from sin. He regenerates us, works to sanctify us and baptize\nus in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. I believe the Holy Spirit loves to comfort us and He is the Spirit of truth. </p>\n<p>It is through the Holy Spirit that we\nreceive gifts (1 Corinthians 12). It is through the Holy Spirit that we bear fruit. Finally I\nbelieve without the Holy Spirit you can’t bear any fruit. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sin\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sin\" aria-label=\"sin permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sin</h2>\n<p>As far as man I believe that man was created in the image of God. That man became\nseparated from God when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden.(Genesis 3) As a result\nwe are all born as sinners and are in need of a savior. A one and only true savior in the\nname of Jesus Christ that gives us the gift of salvation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"salvation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#salvation\" aria-label=\"salvation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Salvation</h2>\n<p>I strongly believe in the gift of salvation and that it is not something someone can earn\nor boast about. It is a gift given to us by the amazing grace of Jesus Christ (Ephesians\n2:8). To receive this free gift you must have faith and believe in Jesus Christ. You must\nbelieve that he died on the cross for your sins. That he rose from the dead and that your\nin need of a savior who can set you free the penalty of your sins. </p>\n<p>Once you accept Jesus\nas Lord and repent of your sins you are born again and have eternal life in Jesus Christ\n(John 3:16). You become a new creation in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:17) How great is\nthat?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-church\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-church\" aria-label=\"the church permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Church</h2>\n<p>As far as the church. I believe the church is composed of all true believers, both living\nand dead, who have been indwelt and sealed by the Holy Spirit through faith in Jesus\nChrist. I believe that everyone should be part of a church and that everyone should be\nactive members in their church helping to serve the church and have it grow. One can’t\ngrow spiritually if they are not part of an active church.</p>\n<h2 id=\"end-times\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#end-times\" aria-label=\"end times permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>End Times</h2>\n<p>Finally, I believe in Heaven and the rapture.
