This could be prothetic to His second coming. When Jesus will put and end to the tribulation. What this shows is that God really cares for you. So cast your cares on Him and He will give you rest(Matthew 11:28).</p>\n<p>So don’t tell God about your problems but leave them with Him. Lay it at His feet as we can’t be God. So let God take care of your problems and He will be exalted high. </p>\n<p>Finally the most important part is that we can’t run to God unless He is our savior. Do you know Christ personally? Is He your lord and savior? If not now is the time(Revelation 3:20) to know Him and trust Him as your Lord.  </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-to-do-when-life-falls-apart","tagSlugs":["/tag/refuge/","/tag/spiritual-warfare/","/tag/psalms/","/tag/worry/","/tag/fear/","/tag/anxiety/","/tag/devotional/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-09T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Ever feel like things are not going in your favor and everything is going wrong for you?
