People were devastated they thought their savior was truly dead. </p>\n<p>The stone was rolled away! The tomb was empty!\nThe stone was rolled away not for Jesus but so the disciples could come in. </p>\n<p>Their was two angels one at the foot and one at the head.</p>\n<p>What was the angels message. </p>\n<p>Fear not in verse 6</p>\n<p>We don’t need to fear because Jesus is alive.\nHe was not there. He was not in the tomb. He had risen like He said He would. </p>\n<p>I believe the three greatest events in history.</p>\n<p><strong>The incarnation</strong> - Jesus was God in flesh.\n<strong>The crucification</strong> - Jesus died in subsitution for us. He paid His own body for our sins. So we can be freed from sin’s penalty.\n<strong>The ressurection</strong> - The basis of the Christian fatih.\nHow do we know Jesus rose from the dead. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jesus told us He would rise. </li>\n<li>The tomb was empty. Jesus physically raised from the dead. It wasn’t just spiritual. His body physically raised. </li>\n<li>Jesus was seen alive for 40 days and 40 nights. </li>\n<li>The conversion of Saul and many others</li>\n<li>The lives Jesus is changing today. We all have our testimony how Jesus has changed us. We all have become new creations in Christ. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Come see in verse 6</p>\n<p>Come see where the Lord lay. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We can have His pardon</strong>. If christ hasn’t risen we are not free from our sins. 1 Corinthians 15:17</li>\n<li><strong>We have His power</strong>. Ephesians 1:19-20</li>\n<li><strong>We have His purpsose</strong>. God give us a purpose. 1 Corinthians 15:19 Life is vanity without God. Our soul is restless without God. </li>\n<li><strong>We have His presence</strong>. Hebrews 13:5</li>\n<li><strong>We have His pattern</strong> 1 Corinthians 15:20</li>\n<li><strong>We have his promise</strong> - John 14 Jesus will come again for us. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Go tell in verse 7</p>\n<p>The angels told us Mary to tell the apostles the good news.\nThis is just how we should tell others. </p>\n<p>We can’t hope in the government. We can’t hope in our good works. We can only hope in Jesus. </p>\n<p>Ephesians 2:8</p>\n<p>Your brother in Christ,\n<br /> Craig</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amen!</p>\n</blockquote>\n ","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020/04/easter-hope","tagSlugs":["/tag/easter/","/tag/hope/","/tag/ressurection/","/tag/crucification/","/tag/matthew/","/tag/victory/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-12T23:40:32.169Z","description":"","tags":["Easter","Hope","Ressurection","Crucification","Matthew","Victory"],"title":"Easter Hope","socialImage":"/media/posts/do-not-be-troubled.jpg","verse":"Matthew 28:1-7","recommendVerses":["1 Corinthians"],"slug":"easter-hope"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020/04/easter-hope"}}}
