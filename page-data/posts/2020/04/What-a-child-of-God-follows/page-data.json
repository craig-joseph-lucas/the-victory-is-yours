Most christians when they give their testimony they sometimes spend too much time talking about what God has stopped them from doing. It is okay to say what you no longer do but your focus should be on talking about what you now do in your life because of God. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-a-child-of-god-should-do\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-a-child-of-god-should-do\" aria-label=\"what a child of god should do permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What a child of God should do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They should purse righteousness in all they do.</strong> - What does this look like? It means you should always seek to do what is right. Regardless of where you are or who you are with. This holds true when you are out in your neighborhood, at work, or anywhere in public. God is calling us to be good witnesses. We can’t be good witnesses when we don’t see what is right. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>\n<p>“But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They should purse Godliness</strong> - What does this look like? It means you should have a genuine blameless character. A person that is the same person whether they are in public or private. A person that would do the right thing even when nobody is looking. You are simply seeking God. You can’t pursuse Godliness without pursuing the Holy Spirit. In verse 6 we are told Godliness with contentment should be our goal. The Lord is all we need!</li>\n<li><strong>They should pursue faith</strong> - What does this look like? It starts with having a saving faith. This is the faith you have when you accept Jesus Christ as your savior. Saving faith only take a little faith. It’s the sustaining faith you need. This is the faith you have in God when you are going through major trials in your life. This is the kind of faith Peter had when he stepped out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus (Matthew 14:22-33). </li>\n<li><strong>They should purse righteousness in all they do.</strong> - What does this look like? It means you should always seek to do what is right. Regardless of where you are or who you are with. This holds true when you are out in your neighborhood, at work, or anywhere in public. God is calling us to be good witnesses. We can’t be good witnesses when we don’t see what is right. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your brother in Christ,\n<br /> Craig</p>\n<blockquote>\nLord we thank you for this amazing scripture. Help us to be like Paul and remember that you are with us through any trial in life. Help us to be humble and turn to you. Help us to acknowledge that it is your will we want done in our lifes and not us. You want to use us and we can make that happen by believing in Christ and always turning to you in prayer. In the mighty powerful name of Jesus. \n<p>Amen!</p>\n</blockquote>\n ","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020/04/What-a-child-of-God-follows","tagSlugs":["/tag/righteousness/","/tag/godliness/","/tag/faith/","/tag/love/","/tag/steadfastness/","/tag/gentleness/","/tag/1-timothy/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-08T23:40:32.169Z","description":"A man of God should be known for what they do and not what they don't do anymore.","tags":["Righteousness","Godliness","Faith","Love","Steadfastness","Gentleness","1 Timothy"],"title":"What a child of God follows","socialImage":"","verse":"1 Timothy 6:11","recommendVerses":null,"slug":"What-a-child-of-God-follows"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020/04/What-a-child-of-God-follows"}}}
