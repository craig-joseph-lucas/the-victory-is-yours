It is normal to have these feelings.\nAs we can’t do anything on our own about it. We need God. God is our refuge and strength.So remember that and don’t let your heart be troubled.</p>\n<p>This is an amazing passage of scripture.\nLets think about the context.</p>\n<p>This happens right after Jesus had finished washing all His disciples feet.\nHe had just told his disciples that one of His apostles would betray Him.\nNaturally all the apostles were worried.</p>\n<p>On top of that Jesus also just told them that He would only be with them a little longer. Why was this? This was because Jesus was going to go to Heaven to be with the Father and that apostles couldn’t immediatley follow Him. </p>\n<p>Peter responded by saying “Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.”That was when Jesus said that Peter would deny Him three times before Jesus left them.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind Peter was their leader. If peter would deny Christ what would the other apostles do. </p>\n<p>The apostles clearly needed encouragement.That is why Jesus responded with this glorious passage. He didn’t want their hearts to be troubled.</p>\n<img src=\"/media/posts/do-not-be-troubled.jpg\" />\n<h2 id=\"why-should-our-hearts-not-be-troubled\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-should-our-hearts-not-be-troubled\" aria-label=\"why should our hearts not be troubled permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why should our hearts not be troubled?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"we-believe-in-god\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#we-believe-in-god\" aria-label=\"we believe in god permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>We believe in God.</h3>\n<p>So we have Jesus on our side.

He promised that He will come back for His people. The Church. This is a direct reference to the rapture.</p>\n<p>He says that no man comes to the Father but through me. What did He mean by that? This is great essential doctrine. That the only way to heaven is through Jesus. You must put your trust in Jesus as your savior. He died for your sins.\nSo that you can have a life in Heaven with Him. How great is that!\nJesus is the way, the truth and the the life. Oh how glorious that statement is!</p>\n<p>Your brother in Christ,\n<br /> Craig</p>\n<blockquote>\nLord we thank you for this beautiful promise you give us.\nNot just this promise but the many promises you give us.\nYou give us so much hope and a clear blueprint on why we should not let our hearts to be troubled.\nHelp us to remember this everyday and to put it into practice.\nIt's in the Holy mighty name of Jesus that we pray.\n<p>Amen!</p>\n</blockquote>\n ","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020/04/do-not-let-your-heart-be-troubled","tagSlugs":["/tag/worry/","/tag/fear/","/tag/peace/","/tag/grace/","/tag/trust/","/tag/heaven/","/tag/john/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-01T23:40:32.169Z","description":"There is so much grief going on with the world right now due to COVID 19.You may feel totally helpless.
