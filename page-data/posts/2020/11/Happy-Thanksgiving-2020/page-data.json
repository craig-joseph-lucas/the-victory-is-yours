Many things have gone wrong with our nation. The coronavirus, social injustice, fires, and earthquakes. Just to name a few.  Yes many bad things and many big problems. Many trials. Many sorrows. However, one thing that always remains and never changes is God’s love for us.  His love conquers all and nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39). </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/eea4a/2020-thanksgiving.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/8ac56/2020-thanksgiving.webp 240w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/d3be9/2020-thanksgiving.webp 480w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/e46b2/2020-thanksgiving.webp 960w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/af3f0/2020-thanksgiving.webp 1280w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/09b79/2020-thanksgiving.jpg 240w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/7cc5e/2020-thanksgiving.jpg 480w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/6a068/2020-thanksgiving.jpg 960w,\n/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/eea4a/2020-thanksgiving.jpg 1280w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/034eed69a9aa0c8b72f4f75ca17490a0/6a068/2020-thanksgiving.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Gift of Wisdom\"\n          title=\"Gift of Wisdom\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><strong>So what’s there to be thankful for?</strong></p>\n<p>Did you wake up this morning? That’s a blessing. The fact that you have air in your lungs is another blessing.  Do you have a home? Do you have food? These all blessings we can thank God for. Every great gift comes from above(James 1:17).</p>\n<p>So yes we have a lot to be thankful for. Most importantly we can be thankful that God loved us so much He sent His only begotten Son to suffer on the cross and die for our sins(John 3:16). </p>\n<p>Jesus did this voluntarily. Why did He do this? Simply because He loves us(Romans 5:6-8). He wants us to be a part of His family and kingdom. God specifically chose you (Romans 8:15). This is why it’s great to have a thankful heart.</p>\n<p>We are to be thankful for Jesus. We are to be thankful for Gods amazing grace and mercy. God give us new mercies everyday(Lamentations 3:22-23). It’s because of God’s mercies we can live in peace. We can live in love. We can live in freedom.  We can live without fear or anxiety. God is the cure for a broken heart. God is our Hope.</p>\n<p>Our hope is a reason to be externally thankful. Let’s give God the praise He deserves today and everyday.</p>\n<p>Do you not have the hope of Jesus in your life?</p>\n<p><strong>Now is the time for hope. Now is the time to repent and accept Christ as your Lord and Savior.</strong><br>\nThere is so much to gain from accepting Christ as your savior. We as a world need hope.\nWe need Jesus. Now is the time to accept Jesus into your heart. If you hear him knocking let Him in.\nWith Jesus you can be victorious over anything in life. </p>\n<p>Ready but not sure how to accept Christ as your savior? It’s a simple as ABC.</p>\n<p>A - <strong>Admit</strong> that you are sinner and have made mistakes.<br>\nB - <strong>Believe</strong> in your heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose up from the grave on the third day.<br>\nC - <strong>Confess</strong> that Jesus is Lord and Savior. God gave His only begotten son for your sin. A price paid that we can never pay back. All that God asks is for you to confess that Jesus is the Lord of your life.  </p>\n<p>If you pray to God and admit that you are sinner, believe in Jesus Christ, and confess Him as Lord you will be saved. You will become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and receive God’s free gift of the Holy Spirit and a future in heaven with Jesus. </p>\n<p>Did you make this prayer? If so I am very excited for you and I would like to pray for you.\nSend me an <a href=\"mailto:wecanhavevictoryinjesus@gmail.com?subject=I%20prayed%20to%20accept%20Jesus%20Christ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">email</a></p>\n<blockquote>\nHeavenly Father full of grace and mercy. We thank you for being such a loving God that continues to show us mercy each everyday. Even when we don't deserve it. Lord we can never earn your mercy but we can accept Jesus and love others as you want us to love them. Lord we love you and I pray for anyone reading this that they can come to know and rest in the love you show us everyday. I also pray if they don't know you Lord that today is the time to get right with you. Today is the day that they can experience your love, grace and mercy.  \n<p>It’s in the holy precious name of Jesus that I pray.<br>\nAmen</p>\n</blockquote>\n ","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020/11/Happy-Thanksgiving-2020","tagSlugs":["/tag/god/","/tag/gods-mercy/","/tag/mercy/","/tag/salvation/","/tag/thankful/","/tag/thanksgiving/","/tag/justification/","/tag/gods-love/","/tag/psalms/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-11-26T23:40:32.169Z","description":"We can give thanks to God in all times in life.
