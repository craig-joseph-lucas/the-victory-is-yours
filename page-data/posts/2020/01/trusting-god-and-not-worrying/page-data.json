When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?</p>\n<p>Trust begins with being a believer. Do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you do that means you have already put your faith in Jesus Christ. So you have established a relationship of trust in Him as your lord. </p>\n<p>The hard part is to keep that trust in all seasons of your life. In life you will go through many trials. However, be of good cheer because your Lord has conquered the world. (John 16:33)  Trials come into our life to build up our faith and trust. Trials bring you closer to God. How do you become closer? It starts by trusting in God. </p>\n<p>God has a plan for you. He has promised this to us in Jeremiah 29:11. He has great plans for us. For us to have a future with Him.  </p>\n<p>I get it sometimes its hard to have trust when you can’t see every step of the way. However, always remember as a fellow Christian. We walk by faith(2 Corinthians 5:7) and not by sight. Walking by faith requires us to be praying constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17-18). </p>\n<p>Let our prayers be known to God. Do not worry about anything. Instead pray about everything and make your requests be known to God (Philippians 4:6). The peace of God surpasses all understanding and will guard your heart and mind. So relax and don’t worry and let God control. This is His will for you.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </code></pre></div>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020/01/trusting-god-and-not-worrying","tagSlugs":["/tag/faith/","/tag/prayer/","/tag/proverbs/","/tag/worry/","/tag/anxiety/","/tag/devotional/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-24T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Trust is a hard thing to do for some people.
