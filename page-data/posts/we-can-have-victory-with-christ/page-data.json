It’s a clear example of how we can overcome any trial in life.</p>\n<p>How do we do this? My easiest answer is to keep your eyes on Jesus. Think about what happend to Peter when he took his eyes off Jesus. The minute he started to look at the waves he began to drown. This is a classic example of what happens when we take our eyes off Jesus. </p>\n<p>Jesus said <blockquote>\n“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you [f]will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” - John 16:33 </blockquote></p>\n<p>This is the most important thing to remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Chrsit overame sin and death. There is nothing Jesus can’t overcome and we have Jesus on our side. How great is that!?</p>\n<p>In this passage of scripture Jesus sets the exmaple on how to deal with temptation. Jesus is tempted three times by Satan in the desert. </p>\n<p>How does Jesus responds? He responds by using the Sword of the Spirit. This is the only weapon we need to defeat the enemy. It is our offensive and our defense as well. </p>\n<p>Our enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour(1 Peter 5:8). He is very manipulative. That is why it’s so important to know the word of God. Look at how in verse 6 Satan actually tried to twist the truth and use it against Jesus. </p>\n<p>Jesus responded and said it is written you should not temp the Lord your God. By knowing and using the Word of God as a weapon. The enemy can’t condemn us because we have the truth. The Word of God! </p>\n<p>Remember what it says in Romans 8:1.\n<q>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</q></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/we-can-have-victory-with-christ","tagSlugs":["/tag/sermon-notes/","/tag/temptation/","/tag/matthew/","/tag/sin/","/tag/flesh/","/tag/victory/","/tag/devotional/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-20T22:40:32.169Z","description":"The passage of Matthew 4 is one of the greatest inspirational messages.
