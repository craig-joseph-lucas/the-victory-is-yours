When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?</p>\n<p>Trust begins with being a believer. Do you believe in Jesus? If you do that means you have already put your faith into Jesus Christ. So you have established a relationship of trust. </p>\n<p>The hard part is to keep that trust in all seasons of your life. In life you will go through many trials. Trials come into your life to build up your faith and trust. Trials bring you closer to God. How do you become closer? It starts by trusting in God. </p>\n<p>God has a plan for you. He has promised this to us in Jeremiah 29:11. He has plans for us. For us to have a future. </p>\n<p>I get it sometimes its hard to have trust when you canâ€™t see every step of the way. However, always remember. We walk by faith and not by sight. So what can we do? We need to pray constantly. Let our prayers be known to God. Do not worry about anything. Instead pray about everything and make your requests be known to God. Who will answer them according to His will.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/trusting-god-and-not-worrying","tagSlugs":["/tag/faith/","/tag/prayer/","/tag/proverbs/","/tag/worry/","/tag/anxiety/","/tag/daily-devotions/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-24T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Trust is hard thing to do for some people.
