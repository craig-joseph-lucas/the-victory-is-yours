Some of you may be wondering what happened to me? Did I back slide in my relationship with the Good Lord? Did I fall asleep spiritually. Have I been too busy? Did I get sick from Covid, etc? Yes Covid did slow me a down bit but the reason I haven’t been blogging much lately is that God has been preparing our next chapter in ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2021-updates-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has been doing great things in my life. He always is. Whether I notice it or not. The year 2021 has been a year to be grateful. We were able to move into our new home. A home we searched and searched for and almost gave up on. However, God didn’t let that happen to us. He had a plan for us. A good plan. See Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God chose a home for us that we could grow in. The new home gave us a private place for my dad. A private place for my office. A gym, a big yard to store our RV and boat, a bigger pool, and extra bedrooms for the kids to utilize as playrooms. It also gave us a big yard where we can entertain our big family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel totally blessed to call it home. God is so good. We were very thankful for the Home and we decided to dedicate the house to the Lord. We wanted to be good stewards of the home. We started praying about it and decided to start looking for a new church closer to our new home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our neighbor at the time told us about a good church by us. We decided to give it a chance. I started listening to the sermons online for a few weeks before our family attended in person. The church connected right away with our family between the worship, the kids ministry and the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2021-updates-church.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to make the new church our home church and attended for a few months when we heard announcements about an upcoming ministry fair. This fair turned out to have a major impact on our lives. God opened two new doors for us. Two great blessings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-blessing-1---kids-ministry&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#new-blessing-1---kids-ministry&quot; aria-label=&quot;new blessing 1   kids ministry permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Blessing #1 - Kids Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first door was for me in the kids ministry. I feel this is something God has been calling me to do for some time. The Lord has been preparing me. However, I kept saying I wasn’t ready. This time the Lord prompted and I said yes. I said yes to being an assistant teacher. I was super nervous going in but I took the leap of faith and its been such a blessing so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been serving as an assistant teacher in the 8am service every Sunday. Working with children in grades 1 - 5. It truly has been a blessing to serve the kids. They are great. Some of the children you can tell they really have the love of God in their hearts. The kids vary in age and some have been walking with the Lord for awhile. While some are completely new in their walk with the Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the classroom we usually start with some crafts. We then go into worship. Watch a video. After the video we then go into the study. After the study we then spend some time bonding with the kids and working on application of the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the greatest thing about the kids ministry is watching the children praise God. It brings great joy to my heart. In addition working in the kids ministry has equipped me to being a better teach at home with my children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you guys can pray for me that I can be a great blessing to the children at my church. That I can help them grow in maturity in their relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-blessing-2---safe-families-with-olivecrest&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#new-blessing-2---safe-families-with-olivecrest&quot; aria-label=&quot;new blessing 2   safe families with olivecrest permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Blessing #2 - Safe Families with OliveCrest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another blessing that came from the ministry fair. This was us joining a ministry called Safe Families. Safe Families mission is simple. To provide a safe place for children to stay in times of emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some times Moms may have a dire need for help but don’t have the resources or a support system for help. This is where safe families comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe Families is made up of families that have professed their love of Christ and have decided they want to be that support system for a family in need. Think temporary fostering without collecting money from the state. The families that do this they do it because they love God and want to serve Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always been on our heart to want to help children in need. So my wife and I signed up. After going through months of screening we were accepted as a Safe Family. We were so excited and so eager to host. We logged into the database immediately but didn’t find any needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a bit bummed but we stayed patient. That is when we started to get alerts about some families in need. We prayed and responded to a few needs but none of them worked out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a few weeks ago when we got the alert of a family looking for someone to watch their 15 month old girl so they can help an elderly cousin move. This turned out to be our first hosting. It was great an experience and I will be dedicating a whole post about it. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting definitely inspired us. My hope is that I can inspire others by sharing our testimony of God’s greatness. God really does use ordinary people to do extraordinary things. Yes the Good Lord will equip you to do good works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last year has been a year of change and the good Lord has called me to come out of my comfort zone. Which, I am thankful for. It’s when you come out of your comfort zone that you can really grow. When you can really be a life giving presence. It’s when you can really declare victory in the name of Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love you family. Stay tuned for more devotionals and some new features that I am working on for the site. I think you will really like the new feature. It’s a tool to help you remember scripture. We all know the importance of God’s word. It’s living and sharper than any double-edged sword. So let’s make it a goal together family to memorize as much as we can of God’s word! Got to go for now family. Love you all.     &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving]]></title><description><![CDATA[We can give thanks to God in all times in life.

Many things have gone wrong with our nation. The coronavirus, social injustice, fires, and earthquakes. Just to name a few.  Yes many bad things and many big problems. Many trials. Many sorrows. However, one thing that always remains and never changes is God’s love for us.  His love conquers all and nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39). &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s there to be thankful for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you wake up this morning? That’s a blessing. The fact that you have air in your lungs is another blessing.  Do you have a home? Do you have food? These all blessings we can thank God for. Every great gift comes from above(James 1:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes we have a lot to be thankful for. Most importantly we can be thankful that God loved us so much He sent His only begotten Son to suffer on the cross and die for our sins(John 3:16). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did this voluntarily. Why did He do this? Simply because He loves us(Romans 5:6-8). He wants us to be a part of His family and kingdom. God specifically chose you (Romans 8:15). This is why it’s great to have a thankful heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are to be thankful for Jesus. We are to be thankful for Gods amazing grace and mercy. God give us new mercies everyday(Lamentations 3:22-23). It’s because of God’s mercies we can live in peace. We can live in love. We can live in freedom.  We can live without fear or anxiety. God is the cure for a broken heart. God is our Hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is a reason to be externally thankful. Let’s give God the praise He deserves today and everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not have the hope of Jesus in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now is the time for hope. Now is the time to repent and accept Christ as your Lord and Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is so much to gain from accepting Christ as your savior. We as a world need hope.
We need Jesus. Now is the time to accept Jesus into your heart. If you hear him knocking let Him in.
With Jesus you can be victorious over anything in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready but not sure how to accept Christ as your savior? It’s a simple as ABC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A - &lt;strong&gt;Admit&lt;/strong&gt; that you are sinner and have made mistakes.&lt;br&gt;
B - &lt;strong&gt;Believe&lt;/strong&gt; in your heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose up from the grave on the third day.&lt;br&gt;
C - &lt;strong&gt;Confess&lt;/strong&gt; that Jesus is Lord and Savior. God gave His only begotten son for your sin. A price paid that we can never pay back. All that God asks is for you to confess that Jesus is the Lord of your life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pray to God and admit that you are sinner, believe in Jesus Christ, and confess Him as Lord you will be saved. You will become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and receive God’s free gift of the Holy Spirit and a future in heaven with Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you make this prayer? If so I am very excited for you and I would like to pray for you.
Send me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:wecanhavevictoryinjesus@gmail.com?subject=I%20prayed%20to%20accept%20Jesus%20Christ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Heavenly Father full of grace and mercy. We thank you for being such a loving God that continues to show us mercy each everyday. Even when we don&apos;t deserve it. Lord we can never earn your mercy but we can accept Jesus and love others as you want us to love them. Lord we love you and I pray for anyone reading this that they can come to know and rest in the love you show us everyday. I also pray if they don&apos;t know you Lord that today is the time to get right with you. Today is the day that they can experience your love, grace and mercy.  
&lt;p&gt;It’s in the holy precious name of Jesus that I pray.&lt;br&gt;
Amen&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it great to receive gifts? We tend to usually receive the best gifts from someone who knows us well. So naturally its only fitting that God has provided us with the best gift one could ever receive in salvation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With salvation we are given a second chance in life. Isn’t that amazing!? Everything in life becomes new to you because you become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). Your life begins to transforms and you become more like Jesus Christ day by day thanks to the Holy Spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit does this through many different spiritual gifts. Do all christians receive gifts? The answer here is yes. God gives gifts to us based on His will for our lives. A gift God wants us to open very badly. Imagine your father giving you a gift that you put aside and never opened. Your father would be really sad. This is how God feels about the gifts given to us. God wants you to open your spiritual gifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As children of God it should be our goals to become true disciples. A true disciple is someone who leverages the gifts given to them to help further the kingdom of God through ministry and service. Spiritual gifts are given to us by the amazing grace of God. They help empower us to fulfill God’s plan and will for our lives. Each of us may be given different gifts but we all have the same spirit(1 Corinthians 12:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it is very important to never limit yourself and pass on an opportunity to minister because you don’t think you have the right spiritual gifts. If God is calling you to a specific ministry. Rest assured He will equip you for the work in that ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy doesn’t want us to use our spiritual gifts. So he will do everything he can to stop us. The enemy wants us to believe that we are not capable of doing effective ministry. It is his goal to confuse us and cause anxiety. Which, clouds our judgement. The enemy has control of you at that point making it really hard to do any effective ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned this the hard way many times. However, the key to remember is that God will keep opening new doors for ministry if you remain faithful and continue seeking Him. So if you missed an opportunity don’t worry. Get back up on your feet and pray. God will open that new door for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants to use us. Remember, Jesus chose to die for us. See John 3:16. He died because He felt we are worthy. See Romans 5:6-8. He not only believed we are worthy but He saved us do good works. See Ephesians 2:10. As christians we need to live a life where we submit and yield to the Holy Spirit. It is then that you will bear lots of fruit and realize you had spiritual gifts you didn’t even know you had! Remember we have the same spirit in us that raised Jesus from the dead!! See Romans 8:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the perfect example of using spiritual gifts to do the will of the father. Jesus did many wonders (see John 2:1-11, John 4:46-47, Luke 5:1-11, Mark 1:23-28, Mark 1:30-31, Mark 1:40-45, Matthew 8:5-13, Matthew 8:23-27) with His spiritual gifts. One of his biggest spiritual gifts was His ability to lead and heal others. Jesus also used His gifts to serve others. Our ultimate goal of our gifts should be to use them to serve God’s purpose for our life. Jesus did this when he gave His life on the cross for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my main point here is to never doubt yourself. Don’t back down from doing any type of service because you feel you are not ready. God will equip you when you are doing work for the kingdom of God. If you want to make a difference in this fallen world it starts with taking a chance and going out of your comfort zone. That is when God can truly use you for His glory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look at the different spiritual gifts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are in Christ you go through the process of sanctification. This is the Holy Spirit working to transform you to be more like Christ. One way the Holy Spirit does this is by the use of the gift of wisdom which is the Word of God.
It is up to you how you apply what you have learned. The Holy Spirit works as a helper when you need him the most(John 14:26-27). He helps you by discernment. When you are unsure of the right decision. The Holy Spirit will bring to your mind God’s word. This is how God speaks to you! As a result we have the ability to live wisely thanks to our renewed minds(Romans 12:2). It is up to us how we use our renewed minds. Do you want to hold all of your wisdom in or do what God wants us to do? Which is to go into the world and be the light and salt to this fallen world. We should be motivated to walk in wisdom in all we do as we never know who is watching us. When we walk in wisdom we can make a true difference in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are restored by God everyday. When you are in Christ, God forgives your sins past, present, and future. That means everyday when you wake up you have a completely new slate. God’s mercies are new everyday (Lamentations 3:22-23). How great is that!?? God restores us by cleansing us from all righteousness (1 John 1:9). God restores us just like He did with Peter. Let’s think about what happened with Peter. Peter was in a bad place. He let down Jesus not once but three times. Peter had three opportunities to stand up for Jesus and he failed all three times. When Peter realized what he did he had a very troubled heart. This is not God wanted. A broken Peter is no heavenly good. God wants us to live the abundant life. He wants us to be filled with joy. He wants to be in good fellowship with Him. It is us up to us to seek to be restored. This is what Peter did and as a result he was able to fulfill God’s mission for His life. That mission was to establish the church of Jesus Christ. Without restoration and forgiveness this could have never happened. So remember Peter and always forgive others as you can be restoring them just like Peter was restored. So they can make a difference and fulfill the mission God has for their lives.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always hear the saying “just have a little faith”. Believe it or not this is another gift of the Holy Spirit. Yes we can have faith without the Holy Spirit but the question there is what are you putting your faith into? Some people will put their faith in themselves, in their possessions or their finances. You will not get too far doing that. The most important object of our faith should be Jesus Christ. When we put our faith in Him and accept Him as our Lord that is called saving faith. Anyone can have saving faith. It’s the enduring faith which is what you want. This is where the Holy Spirit comes in. The Holy Spirit gives you an extraordinary amount of faith. Which allows you to remain calm through any storm in life. As a result because of this faith you can bear fruit to others and help encourage them and create joy in the toughest situations. When I say you can have extraordinary faith this is not something that only a “superior” christian can have. This is something anyone can have. Whoever is in Christ can demonstrate faith that can move mountains. We have so many good examples of men and women of faith in the bible such as Abraham and Moses. To have extraordinary faith it takes knowing God’s Word and His promises. When you know His promises you can rest in them and be still. See Palm 46:10. When you are still that is when you can let God control your life truly. Remember as Christians we don’t walk by sight we walk by faith. See (2 Corinthians 5:7) When you walk by faith you can really help make a difference in this fallen world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching is definitely a gift. It is not something that can be done easily. It is something that must be done when led by the spirit. When you are a teacher you need to make sure you are always setting a good example. Otherwise you will can come off as a hypocrite to a non believer. Take extra care to guard your mouth and your minds and let no corrupt talk come out of your mouth (Ephesians 4:29). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher you are held to a high standard. Think about when Paul went about teaching the gospel. He ended up facing a lot of opposition. Everyone tried to use his past wrongs to lower his credibility. However, Paul denied himself and let the Holy Spirit lead. Which, should be our goal. Yes even you could be an effective teacher. It starts with having faith, letting the Holy spirit lead you and teaching in love and truth. Most importantly you need to know what you are teaching. So spend as much time in the Word as you can. This way you are ready when God gives you an opportunity to disciple someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As christians it is in our heart to want to help others. Jesus was the biggest servant and He set the example for us on how to serve. Jesus came to serve not to be served. Wow imagine that! A king that didn’t want to use his power to help himself instead he wanted to help others. Talk about humility. This is the goal of helping others. You do it out of humility and out of love. The Holy Spirit works to change the desires of your heart. He gives you a supernatural desire to want to help. The Holy Spirit enables you to help someone by many means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing is one way. When we are kingdom minded we can be confident in asking God for healing for anyone and believe it will happen. Whether it be physically, emotionally or spiritually. You have the ability to restore someone. You have the ability to heal someone thanks to gifts of the Holy Spirit. It is up to you to open that gift and use it for God’s glory.
Remember the two big commandments Jesus said in Matthew 22:37-40. Love God with all your heart and love others as you love yourself. When you love someone like yourself you want to help them with all your heart. This is when you can make a difference in their life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin to discuss the gift of exhortation. Let’s look at the definition of exhort. What does it mean to exhort someone? It simply means to encourage them. What should we encourage others to do? We want to always encourage others to fulfill the purpose God has for their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The christian life is a battlefield. The enemy is always trying to devour us and stop us from fulfilling God’s plan for our lives. See 1 Peter 5:8. This is why it is so important for us to stay in good fellowship with our sisters and brothers in Christ. I recommend always being in a small study group. This way you can be held accountable and you can hold others accountable. How can you encourage others in your group? The bible tells us we should love one another (John 13:34), be devoted to one another (Romans 12:10), honor one another (Romans 12:10), live in harmony with another (Romans 12:16), build up one another (Romans 14:19; 1 Thessalonians 5:11), Care for one another (1 Corinthians 12:25), bear one another’s burdens (Galatians 6:2), forgive one another (Ephesians 4:2, 32; Colossians 3:13), be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32), consider others better than yourselves (Philippians 2:3), encourage one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11), comfort one another (1 Thessalonians 4:18), and pray for one another (James 5:16). These verses are called the one another’s and they are geared toward exhorting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible is filled with many great exhorter’s. Let’s look at one. James was one of the biggest exhorters. The whole book of James purpose is encourage you to do what God is calling you to do and live a more righteous life. It is one of the most practical book’s in the bible. James was pushing the people of the church to not only be listeners of the word but doers of the Word (James 1:22-25). James was always encouraging his brothers and sisters in Christ in love to live the life God wanted for them. You can do do the same if you are doer of Gods Word. We can’t make a difference for the kingdom of God if we are only listeners. So go out there and exhort your fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verses to read&lt;/strong&gt; - Hebrews 3:13, 2 Timothy 4:2-5, Romans 12:8, Hebrews 10:24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes we as christian’s can show mercy. You may ask why should we show mercy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple because God shows us new mercies everyday (Lamentations 3:22-23). He expect us to do the same in return. We have the gift of the Holy Spirit who will help us show empathy to others. When we show empathy it is much easier to show mercy to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may say yea you don’t know what he/she did to me? How can I forgive them? You can forgive them because Jesus forgave you of every last sin you committed in the past, present, and future. How great is that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I like to always say to not forgive and forget but to forgive and remember what Jesus did for you.
One way you show gratitude to Jesus is by showing mercy to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets break it down. Why should I show mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you show mercy to others Jesus will show mercy to you. See Matthew 5:7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus showed mercy to all people. One example is when he forgave the women who had committed adultery. See John 8:1-11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we don’t show mercy we are harboring anger towards that person. When we have anger towards someone it will eventually turn to hate. When we hate someone we have already murdered them in our heart and have sinned. See 1 John 3:15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are saying now that you want to show mercy but have a hard time doing it. How does one proceed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is very clear. You turn to God and seek His power. You seek his mercy. You seek His meekness. YOu seek the Holy Spirit. When you deny yourself and keep a Christ centered perspective you will be able to show mercy to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about all the conflict right now in the world. If everyone just demonstrated a little more mercy to one another. The world would be a much better place. Remember it is not up to us to seek revenge or to try to judge others. There is only one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and destroy. See James 4:11-12. So isn’t it better to show mercy and throw everything at the feet of Jesus. This is what He wants. We can bring Heaven to earth when we show mercy to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Heavenly father. We thank you for giving us the best gift one could ever receive in salvation. We have this gift because of Jesus. Jesus was the perfect example on how to use spiritual gifts. His whole purpose was to fulfill your plan for our lives. Jesus came humbly and denied His majesty for us. He suffered and died for us. He loved us so much. Lord we want to be like Jesus. He is our role model and our Lord. He is our everything. Lord we ask for your help to empower us to use the spiritual gifts you have given us through the work of the Holy Spirit to be the salt and light in this fallen world. Help us to make a great impact. Help us to live your will for our life&apos;s. Help us to bring Heaven to earth Lord. Help us to be great disciples.
&lt;p&gt;It’s in the precious name of Jesus Christ that I pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book of James is a very practical book. It is meant to teach us how to act in a more righteous manner. The more righteous we are the better someone has a chance to see God working in you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage James is talking about why we shouldn’t be full of pride.
Pride can be a very dangerous thing. Pride is the the work of the enemy.  Pride is one of three temptations that lead to sin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not aware. The three Temptations of Sin are the Lust of the Flesh, Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.  See 1 John 2:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are full of pride it’s hard to put the needs of others first. Which is what God wants us to do. See Philippians 2:3-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a child of God involves practicing J.O.Y. What does this acronym stand for? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;esus&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;thers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;ou  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-we-put-jesus-first&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-should-we-put-jesus-first&quot; aria-label=&quot;why should we put jesus first permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why should we put Jesus first?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus put us first when He suffered (Isaiah 53:5) for our sin (2 Corinthians 5:21) and died on the cross. Jesus is our clear example and leader on what it means to be humble and not full of pride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came to die for us. He came humbly. He put aside his deity and took the form of a bond servant. See  Philippians 2:7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about sacrificing for us! He wanted the Fathers will for His life. Jesus only did what was in the Fathers will. Even after being tempted by Satan in the desert. Jesus showed true meekness when He said no to Satan. You may think yea but Jesus is God so He has the power to do anything. Let’s not forget though that Jesus had put aside His deity and He had taken on humanity. So He experienced all the struggles of the flesh like we do but He still said no to Satan. How did He do this? He focused on Gods plan and will. One example was when Jesus prayed for God’s will to be done the night before He was to suffer and die for our sins. See Matthew 26:38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are full of pride it makes it really hard for you to allow God’s plan for your life. Remember you want Gods plan for your life not yours. Never lean on your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are full of pride you are also not obeying God. Pride has you saying I deserve better. Pride has you saying no I won’t apologize as I was not wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I say pride is a bad thing. Does this mean you should not be proud about accomplishments? Of course not.
Pride can be good. Especially when its for others. Like your children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fellow parent you become so full of pride when your kid does well in life. The key though is to give the glory back to God. Make it an opportunity to be proud but also an opportunity to praise God more importantly.
You are proud when good things happen. James 1:17 tell us all great things and gifts come from God. This is why we should always remain humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally remember that pride comes from the enemy. We live in a world that is full of pride. A world where people want to follow their own plans and not God’s plan. This is not good as it will only lead to more sin and division in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s be humble and always ask God for forgiveness. Don’t also be too proud to ask for forgiveness. It is okay to be wrong we all make mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in 2 chronicles 7:14. “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some final tips. When you pray to God make sure to come humbly. Start by telling Him how great He is. Follow by denying yourself. I usually say Lord I don’t deserve your love as I continue to fail you everyday when I sin but you still love me. Proceed to ask God for forgiveness so you can be in good fellowship with Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can pray and ask for God’s will to be done in your life. If after doing so you are still not sure of God’s will. Ask God for discernment on His will. This is the kind of prayer God’s answers. God will give you grace when you are humble. &lt;/p&gt;

Heavenly father. We thank you for love. We thank you for Jesus dying for our sin. It&apos;s because of Him that we have a savior. It&apos;s because of Jesus we have hope. It&apos;s because of Jesus we have a clear example on how to live and treat others. You want us to be humble and to seek you in every thing we do. To seek your will and not our will. You have great plans for us and we trust in those plans. Thank you again Father.  
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus Holy precious name we pray
Amen&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s look at the definition of mercy.
I did a search online and this is what I found. “Compassion or forgiveness shown toward someone whom it is within one’s power to punish or harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-god-show-us-mercy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-does-god-show-us-mercy&quot; aria-label=&quot;how does god show us mercy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How does God show us mercy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that we all fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) and not one of us is righteous (Romans 3:10). Nothing we can ever do can earn God’s mercy for us as sinners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is hope. We have such a loving and Sovereign God that loves us so much. So much that He sent His only begotten son to die for us. See John 3:16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did Jesus die for us. Jesus was mocked, tortured and suffered for us. He took our place on the cross voluntarily. That is love. There is no greater love than to lay your life down for the people you love. See John 15:13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did this for us. Talk about receiving mercy from God. Remember that the penalty for sin is eternal death (Romans 6:23) but thanks be to Jesus Christ our Lord. Since Jesus died and resurrected. He defeated the law of Sin and death for us! As a result we are not subjected to the law of sin and death. See Romans 8:1-2. So we can be justified before a Holy God. We are no longer separated from God for eternity. I don’t know any better deal you can receive in life. Now that is mercy. God is mercy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what is even greater about God’s mercy towards us? That His mercies are new everyday (Lamentations 3:22-23). So even as Christians today when we continue to make mistakes and sin. We fail to live up to God’s standards everyday. But God continues to forgive us and show new mercies to us every single day. God shows us mercy for our past, our present and our future. Isn’t that so great!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind. God is so full of mercy but He will only show mercy to you when you accept his only begotten son Jesus Christ as your savior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this current world we have so much violence, division and hate going on now. We are a nation that has turned away from God. In a time when we need God most. God is the only one who can restore our nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now is the time to repent and accept Christ as your Lord and Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is so much to gain from accepting Christ as your savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time because Jesus will be coming back soon to judge the world. See Matthew 25:31-46. To judge all the unbelievers and that is when the world will face the wrath of God. I don’t know about you but I much rather have the mercy of God vs the wrath of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to accept Christ and experience God’s mercy and love. If you would like to do so. You need to have some faith and decide to turn away from your sin. You need to be saved. Salvation begins with the ABC’s of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A - &lt;strong&gt;Admit&lt;/strong&gt; that you are sinner and have made mistakes.&lt;br&gt;
B - &lt;strong&gt;Believe&lt;/strong&gt; in your heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died on the cross for your sins, and that he rose up from the grave on the third day.&lt;br&gt;
C - &lt;strong&gt;Confess&lt;/strong&gt; that Jesus is Lord and Savior. God gave His only begotten son for your sin. A price paid that we can never pay back. All that God asks is for you to confess that Jesus is the Lord of your life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pray to God and admit that you are sinner, believe in Jesus Christ, and confess Him as Lord you will be saved. You will become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and receive God’s free gift of the Holy Spirit and a future in heaven with Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you make this prayer? If so I am very excited for you and I would like to pray for you.
Send me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:wecanhavevictoryinjesus@gmail.com?subject=I%20prayed%20to%20accept%20Jesus%20Christ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Heavenly Father full of grace and mercy. We thank you for being such a loving God that continues to show us mercy each everyday. Even when we don&apos;t deserve it. Lord we can never earn your mercy but we can accept Jesus and love others as you want us to love them. Lord we love you and I pray for anyone reading this that they can come to know and rest in the love you show us everyday. I also pray if they don&apos;t know you Lord that today is the time to get right with you. Today is the day that they can experience your love, grace and mercy.  
&lt;p&gt;It’s in the holy precious name of Jesus that I pray.&lt;br&gt;
Amen&lt;/p&gt;

Something you are not sure how it will end. A serious trial that you feel may never end. Maybe the coronavirus has you feeling the blues. Or maybe it’s the racial inequities that have you feeling that way. This is the work of the enemy. He wants to condemn you. When I say condemn it means to knock down. To make you feel there is no way out that. That there is no hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exact opposite of what God wants us to feel. God wants to always convict us. To encourage us. To inspire us and always give us hope. There are many promises of God in the Bible. One of my favorite ones is Romans 8:1
Which says “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”.
So always keep that in mind so you can keep your eyes focused on Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you praying to God each day remember that promise God has for your life. This way you can focus on Heavenly things and you will be able to dream boldly. Boldly like Moses. You can be the leader like Moses was.
Think about Moses time when all the people of Israel were in denial they thought they had no chance to survive and to escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses had faith and believed that God would deliver them out of bondage. He knew God was on their side. When God commanded Moses to lift his hand. Moses obeyed God by faith and the result was that He split the Red Sea into two. Imagine that!! Talk about deliverance and God being our refuge. All the Israel people were able to walk right through the sea on dry land to safety where there once was all water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God delivered His people back then and can deliver His people today. There is no situation in life to big for God!! So trust in God and be bold like Moses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gracious Father God you are a God of promises. You are a God of love. You are a God that takes care of His people. You delivered your people from a situation that seemed so impossible. Nothing is impossible for you. We are so blessed to have a God that loves us so much. Thank you Lord for giving us the blessed assurance that we can trust in you in all we do.
&lt;p&gt;In the Holy Precious name of Jesus we pray.
Amen&lt;/p&gt;

The world is very divided right now! The world needs God more than ever. We can make the change the world needs by loving the way God instructs us too! This passage in Acts gives us the guidelines on how to love the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three essentials to a living church. For any church to bear fruit it needs to be a loving church, learning church and a growing church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today I would like to talk about the characterisitics of a loving church.
Before I begin I would like to address who makes up the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is composed of all true believers, both living and dead, who have been indwelt and sealed by the Holy Spirit through faith in Jesus Christ. To have the Holy Spirit we need to be saved. We need to believe in Jesus and repent for our sins. That is how we obtain salvation. It is a gift of God by His amazing grace. See Ephesians 2:8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are saved we are born into God’s family this is called regeneration,or to be born again. God becomes our father and all other believers become our brothers and sisters in Christ. It is then that we are called into a loving fellowship with the church and the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loving fellowship is so important. If we love God we should be committed to fellowship with our brothers and sisters in Christ. One of the key word in this passage is fellowship.Fellowship means koinonia in Greek, which means joint participation. Or to share something in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellowship in the church today has lost its real meaning today. Everyone associates it with food. We as a nation love to eat. When we have fellowship with our brothers and sisters in Christ. We usually do it over lunch, dinner, etc. Food is great but the real goal should be to love and edify your brothers and sisters in Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we should fellowship is because we have lot in common with other believers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bible tells us that we share a common salvation in Jude 3. It also tells us that there is only one way to be saved. We are all saved by God’s grace alone. See Ephesians 2:8. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are saved through faith. See Ephesians 2:8. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are saved in Christ alone. See Acts 4:12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-share-a-common-sanctification&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#we-share-a-common-sanctification&quot; aria-label=&quot;we share a common sanctification permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We share a common sanctification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is working through us to make us better day by day through the process of sanctification. Sanctification comes after being justified by a Holy God. What does it mean to be justified? This is when you are declared righteous by a Holy God based on the finish work of Jesus Christ on the cross. All Christians are justified when they put their faith in Jesus Christ. All christians are all equal in God’s eye. One christian can’t be more justified than another christian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being justified the process of sanctification begins. This is a lifelong process. The goal of sanctification is to make you more like Jesus day by day. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit takes the word of God to transform the child of God into the image of the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does God transform us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the Holy Spirit - God gave us the free gift of the Holy Spirit to help us. See John 14:16 and Romans 15:19&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the Word of the God - We can’t become Holy without the bible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By prayer - We need to be in constant prayer. God will give us the wisdom. See James 1:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this common service we are to practice the “one in anothers” in the new testament. With our goal to serve others, love others and glorify Christ in all we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt; one another (John 13:34 - This command occurs at least 16 times throughout the bible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be devoted to&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Romans 12:10)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgive&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Ephesians 4:2, 32; Colossians 3:13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be patient with&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Ephesians 4:2; Colossians 3:13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak the truth in love to&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Ephesians 4:15, 25)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be kind and compassionate to&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Ephesians 4:32)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak to&lt;/strong&gt; one another &lt;strong&gt;with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs&lt;/strong&gt; (Ephesians 5:19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submit to&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Ephesians 5:21, 1 Peter 5:5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider&lt;/strong&gt; others &lt;strong&gt;better than yourselves&lt;/strong&gt; (Philippians 2:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look to the interests of&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Philippians 2:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear with&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Colossians 3:13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Colossians 3:16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;/strong&gt; one another (1 Thessalonians 4:18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage&lt;/strong&gt; one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhort&lt;/strong&gt; one another (Hebrews 3:13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir up [provoke, stimulate]&lt;/strong&gt; one another &lt;strong&gt;to love and good works&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show hospitality to&lt;/strong&gt; one another (1 Peter 4:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employ the gifts that God has given us for the benefit&lt;/strong&gt; of one another (1 Peter 4:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothe yourselves with humility towards&lt;/strong&gt; one another (1 Peter 5:5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pray&lt;/strong&gt; for one another (James 5:16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confess your faults&lt;/strong&gt; to one another (James 5:16) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if we all loved by the examples provided here and put others needs first. The world would be such a more loving place. The world would be more united. The world would not be in such great turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we all acted out of love and remember that we are all sisters and brothers in Christ. That we are all serving the same God that loves us for who we are. A loving God that gave His only begotten son for us. So that we can do good works. So that we can love others by like we love ourselves. The true identifying mark of a christian is love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gracious Father oh how we need you so much right now Lord. As a world we have forgotten how to love. Forgotten how to love as you want us to love. Lord we are at your mercy Lord and we seek your forgiveness. We seek your wisdom to turn from our wicked ways. Cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness. We want to be in great fellowship with you Father. We need your more than ever. We seek your wisdom on going back to loving as you want us to love. Help us to remembet that we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. Help us to share the love you share for us towards other. Help us to put others first. Help us to be the salt and the light of the world.
In Jesus holy precious name I pray.

Everything we do as a church is an act of worship. Let's take a look at how we are to worship God.]]></description><link>https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/2020/06/worshipping-church</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/2020/06/worshipping-church</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 23:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that God created you to worship Him? Everything we do as a church is an act of worship. Let’s take a look at how we are to worship God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to remember is that everything we do is an act of worship.
When we sing to God. Or when we give tithes. Whether, it is serving others.
Praying, communion, fellowship or reading the bible. These are all forms of worship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to worship Him with all our heart and in spirit.
Our main priority should be to worship God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day we will go to heaven and the only thing we will want to do is worship God. All day long and all night long. Doesn’t that excite you? It sure excites me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think evangelizing is the #1 priority as christians.
I don’t believe this is true. I believe worship is the most important thing as it is the only thing we can take to Heaven with us. We will not be able to evangelize anymore once we get to Heaven as we will be surrounded by brothers and sisters that are in Christ already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s spend some time going through this passage and see how we are to worship God.
From this passage we can gather 5 marks of a worshipping church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-marks-of-a-worshipping-church&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5-marks-of-a-worshipping-church&quot; aria-label=&quot;5 marks of a worshipping church permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5 marks of a worshipping church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The church has a balanced worship&lt;/strong&gt; - Firstly. They worship formally and informally. In verse 46 it mentions how the apostles not only attended the temple together but they also broke bread together in each other’s homes. We are to worship in corporate and at home or anywhere we go.in Psalm 95:1. Worhip should be joyful. Secondly they worship in joy and reverence. What does reverence mean? It simply means to have a deep respect for God.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The church is worshipping biblically&lt;/strong&gt; -  Worship should be based on God’s revelation to us in the bible You can’t worship God without knowing the bible. Otherwise you are worshipping yourself. You are creating your own image of God. When we know the bible. We know God and we can truly worship Him. Our worship is to be done in spirit and truth. See John 4:23-24. Worship is to be with all your mind, your body and will. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The church is worshipping congregationally&lt;/strong&gt; - The bible tells us we should worship congregationally. See  Psalam 149:1, Hebrews 10:25,Ephesians 5:18-20. Yes you should worship God wherever you are but there is power in congregational worship. Remember when Jesus said that when two are together I am there with you. So every church should make it a goal to worship together congregationally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worship should be spiritual&lt;/strong&gt; - You should be spirit led when you worship. See Isaiah 29:13 and Phillipians 3:3. This is because we want the full focus on Jesus. We need the Holy Spirit because He energizes and directs and leads us to worship Christ. Everything the Holy Spirit does is to glorify Christ. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worship should be transformative&lt;/strong&gt; - True Worship flows from an obedient life. True worship comes from a surrendered heart. God wants your heart. What good is your worship if it doesn’t transform your life. We must and should want to sacrifice everything to Jesus. Get on your knees and show God gratitude that He has changed your life for good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap worshipping God should be our priority as christians. We should push to worship God in truth and in spirit in all we do. We should worship God together corporately with our brothers and sisters in Christ. We should also worship God whereever and whenever we can. God has transformed our lives so why not worship Him every chance you have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gracious Father we have so many reasons to worship. You are our Lord and Savior. You have transformed our lives. You have given us so much hope. Help us to be filled with your spirit in all we do. So we can worship you the way you want to us. Which, is in Spirit and truth. Thank you again Father we love you very much.
&lt;p&gt;It’s in Jesus holy name that we pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Remember that you can never lose your salvation. 1 John is a great essential doctrine passage that shows us we can be assured of our salvation.]]></description><link>https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/2020/05/asssurance-you-are-saved</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/2020/05/asssurance-you-are-saved</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 23:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is the work of the enemey to confuse us and make us think we are not saved. However, salvation is not something you can lose. The enemy wants you to think that. 1 John is an essential doctrine passage that shows us we can be assured of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this passage is in verse 13.
That you may know that you have eternal life when you are IN Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to know that we have salvation. See John 17:3. God wants us to not only know but also be assured. When we have assurance we can live an abundant life like Jesus wants us to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that a person can be saved but not be sure of it? This is very true of new believers. It is the goal of the enemy to confuse you. See 2 Peter 1:10. So don’t let him!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-we-have-assurance-of-salvation&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-can-we-have-assurance-of-salvation&quot; aria-label=&quot;how can we have assurance of salvation permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How can we have assurance of Salvation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Word of God the Father&lt;/strong&gt; -  The bible tells us we have assurance. In John 3:16 we are told that we can have eternal life with God when we believe in Jesus Christ. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Work of God the Son&lt;/strong&gt; - In verse 11 and 12 we are also told that when we have the Son we are saved. We have eternal life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died on the cross to save us sinners and to satisfy the requirements of a righteous Holy God. See Romans 3:22-23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prayer of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; - In John 17:24 Jesus prays to the father that we can go to Heaven with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The promises of God&lt;/strong&gt; - In John 14:3 Jesus promised that He would come back for us and that He is preparing a place for us in Heaven with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The work of the Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; - We are given the gift of the Holy Spirit when we repent and access Jesus as our savior. The Holy Spirit is the seal of our salvation. See Romans 1:13. We are sealed with the Holy Spirit the moment we are saved. Isn’t that so great? The Holy Spirit then works to convict you of your sin, He works to regenerate you, and endwells us. The Holy Spirit is the earnest of our savalation. This is a reference to our inheritance of the Holy Spirit. Finally the Holy Spirit is witness to our spirits that we are children of God. See Romans 8:15-16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fruit of the Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; - This is an external witness that we are children of God. It is by the spirit that we can bear fruit. See Galatians 5:22. When you bear fruit that is evidence of the Holy Spirt and evidence of your salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when you are saved you are a new creation in Christ, 2 Corinthians 5:17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be assured that you are and that you have the gift of the Holy Spirit helping, you through sanctifiation. Sanctification is a life long process. So if you are not bearing fruit as quick as you want. Don’t worry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the assurance you can be focused on what God wants you to do. That is to have love in your heart for all people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the work of the cross we can overcome the attacks of the wicked one(1 John 5:4) as we have been cleansed from all unrighteousness. See 1 John 1:9, which is often referred to as the Christians bar of soap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion there is no reason in world that we can’t be confident in the assurance we have of our the salvation. The assurance that we are children of God. We have the assurance of God’s love and nothing can ever seperate us from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are reading this and realize that you want this assurance. That you want salvation. It is through believing in Jesus that we can get this free gift of salvation thanks to God’s amazing grace. Do you know Jesus? Do you really know him and have a personal relationship with Him? If not now is the time. The time to get right with Christ. To get free from sin. To become a new creation in Christ. To have that assurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible says if you hear Jesus knocking its time to let Him into your heart (Revelation 3:20). Now is the time of acceptance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to make that leap of faith. I am very happy for you. That decision will change your life drastically for the good. Now repeat after me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus I know I am a sinner and there is only one way to be forgiven for my sins. It is to put my faith and trust in you. I believe you were born of the virgin Mary and lived a sinless life. That you took my place and died on the cross for my sin. I belive that you ressurected from the dead three days later and that you are exhalted and seated at the right hand of the Father. I want to turn away from my sin and follow you. Please come into my heart and be my Lord. In Jesus Holy name I pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just prayed that prayer I am very happy for you and would like to hear from you. Drop me &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:wecanhavevictoryinjesus@gmail.com?subject=I Prayed to receive Jesus Christ&quot;&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; so I can be in touch and get you started on your walk with Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, Heavenly Father. We are so blessed to be children of God. We are so blessed to have the assurance you give us. The assurance through the seal of the Holy Spirit. The assurance through the promises in your Word and the assurance through the work of Jesus. Help us to rest in those promises and help us to focus on your will for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus holy name I pray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I take a look at some of those blessings in my lastest devotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-we-blessed-because-of-the-cross&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-are-we-blessed-because-of-the-cross&quot; aria-label=&quot;why are we blessed because of the cross permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why are we blessed because of the cross?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have peace with God&lt;/strong&gt; - this is through Justificiation. Justification is when we are declared righteous before a Holy God. This is an act of God only. This is not something that any man or woman can earn. It is only possible thanks to the work of the cross. If Jesus didn’t die on the cross and ressurect we would still be in our sins and could never have peace with God. See 1 Corinthians 15:14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have access to God&lt;/strong&gt; - in verse 2 it says we access to God. We are no longer seprated from God because of our sin. We can now come to God through Jesus Christ who intercedes for us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We rejoice in the hope of God&lt;/strong&gt; - in verse 3 we are told that we rejoice in the hope of God. This is a reference to the hope of Heaven. That one day we will be together with the Lord. Jesus is preparing a place for us. (See John 14:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can rejoice in our trials&lt;/strong&gt; - in verse 4 and 5 we are told that yes even in trials we can rejoice. We can rejoice in trials because we know God is building us up and making us stronger. We need to remember that sometimes trials come into our life to draw us closer to God. So hang in there and know that Jesus is with you through every storm and to be of good cheer because He conquered the world!(John 16:33). Finally when God delivers you out of that storm you will be giving an opportunity to magnify Christ. So rejoice my brothers and sisters in Christ! Rejoice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The love of God is poured out on our heart&lt;/strong&gt; - God’s love has been poured out on us through the Holy Spirit. How do we know God loves us? In verse 5 we are told that God poured out his love through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a gife He gave us. A gift we didn’t deserve. A gift we can never earn. God gave His only begotten son for us. For a righteous person one would not die for but Jesus died for us sinners, for the ungodly, for the unrighteousness. If God gave His only son for us what wouldn’t he give us(Romans 8:32). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are saved from the wrath of God&lt;/strong&gt; - In verse 9 we are told since we are justified by the blood of Christ we are now spared from the wrath of God. Jesus took the wrath of God for our sin by dying on the cross. We escaped judgement thanks to Jesus!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have joy in God&lt;/strong&gt; -  In verse 10 we are told we can have the joy of the Lord because we now have reconciliation with God because of Jesus dying for our sin. Since we now have justification we now have fellowship with God again. Isn’t that such a great blessing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification is such a great blessing to us. It really changes our live and gives us so much peace. The blessings of justification are available to ALL believers that are in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We are justified by the work of the cross. When justified we have the peace of God, we have fellowship with God, we have the Joy of God and most importantly we have the love of God. How great is that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord it is by the work of the cross we have all these amazing blessings. We know this is all posssible thanks to Jesus Christ. We know these blessings are not something we can ever earn. These blessings come from the love you pour out to us through your Holy Spirit. We are so blessed that you shed your wrath on us sinners thanks to Jesus Christ. We are very grateful for your love and your blessings. We are grateful to be justified through the blood of Jesus. It’s in Jesus Holy name we pray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s around 18% of the population. Wow! Some of us try different ways to deal with their anxiety. Some turn to medicine. Some turn to alcohol. None of these are the answer. Jesus is the only answer. Want to know why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage Paul is addressing all his fellow believers. Paul really loved the people of Phillipi and he didn’t want them to be anxious.
So what is anxiety? Anxiety is a feeling of worry. It’s a feeling of unease. A feeling of constant thinking and worrying about things that we ourselves can’t control. We all have gone through anxiety at times in life. Some of us may be going through it right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is the work of the enemy. The enemey wants us to worry because when we worry we can’t do anything to further the kingdom of God. So what are we to do as Christians? We are to meditate on God’s word and pray. Phillipians 4 is a perfect outline on how we are to deal with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this time of panademic a lot of people are worrying. Some are worrying will they have a job? Will they be able to provide food for their family? These are all valid concerns. However, God doesn’t want us to worry. Someone once said worry is a conversation you have with yourself about things you can’t change on your own. While prayer is a conversation with God who can change things. So the big takeaway here is to stay faithful. Let’s take a look at the scripture now and see how God wants us to deal with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-have-gods-presence-verse-5&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#we-have-gods-presence-verse-5&quot; aria-label=&quot;we have gods presence verse 5 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We have God’s presence (Verse 5)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 5 Pauls says the Lord is at hand. What does he mean by that?
He is saying that we have Gods presence.
Since we have God’s presence we should do the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should stand fast in the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should be of the same mind. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should always rejoice in the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God’s presence is alive in our heart we have joy and His peace. When we are of the same mind we can get along with others more. God will help you to love others, forgive them and get along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes its hard to feel God’s prescence. We may rush through everything in our laundry list. However, we need to slow down. When we slow we can see God in every situation. When we see God in every situation we can rest in His promises and know that He has a plan for us and we don’t need to worry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 7 Paul says that we have the peace of God. We have the peace of the God through the Holy Spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit guard and protects our minds.
I love his choice of words. When I heard guard It makes me think of a big battle. So God is protecting us in a war we are going through.
It’s true our mind and heart are under constant attack by the enemy. So God is on our side working to protect our emotions and our thoughts.
So always remember we have the peace of God. See John 14:27&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to pray correctly - we are to pray about everything. Not just big things but small things as well. Prayer is so powerful. So if you want peace make your requests known to God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is 4 ways to pray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to pray with adoration&lt;/strong&gt; - simply tell God how great he is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to pray with appreciation&lt;/strong&gt; - tell God what you are grateful for. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to pray with supplication&lt;/strong&gt; - when we pray to God with supplication we are asking God for His help. When we ask for Gods’ help always come humbly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to pray with petition.&lt;/strong&gt; - this is when we pray to God for a specific need. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is so important because God wants us not to be anxious and instead come to Him with our worries. See 1 Peter 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 13 which is my favorite bible Paul tells us we have the strength of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are in Christ we have the power of the Holy Spirit helping us. So we can do all things through Christ. Not just some things but ALL things through Jesus Christ. God is our helper. God enables us and gives us strength.When you have God’s power you can be content with any situation in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people take this verse and take it out of context. Paul is not saying you can jump from one building to another building because you have Christ on your side. He is saying this in regards to what God is calling you to do.  You can succeed in your ministry. You can overcome spiritual warfare. You can be a Godly dad. You can be a Godly husband. Think about it. We have the same strength that raised Christ from the grave on our side!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verse 19 Paul mentions that God has promised to provide for us from the riches of God’s glory. We all know God’s glory is unmeasurable. We also know that God has given up his only begotten son for us(John 3:16). So what won’t he give to us? Jesus once said that He has come so we can have an abundant life in Him (John 10:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL Moody called verse 19. God’s blank check.
How great is that? To think about having a blank check from God.
So when worry comes try to relax and think about the promises God has given us. He wants us to have an abundant life and He will provide for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap so why should we not worry?
We shouldn’t worry because we have Gods prescence, His peace, His power and His provision. That is more than anything else we will ever need in life!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious Father you are a gracious father indeed! It’s because of your grace that we can have the peace. It’s by your grace we are saved from a life without hope. Saved from a life filled with anxiety. You don’t want us to worry instead you want us to cast our fears and worries at your feet. Your love is so amazing Lord it overflows surely. Thank you for being such an amazing father to us. Than you for giving us your presence so freely. Thank you for the peace you can bring even in the craziest storms. Thank you for the power you supply to all your children. You enable us and you protect our hearts and minds. Most importantly you provide for your children through your riches and grace everyday. Help us to stand in your word and your promises and keep us strong so we can withstand the enemy with your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its in the wonderful powerful name of Jesus that we pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It’s when you are declared righteous before a Holy God. How great is that!! Ever wonder what happens to your life after making that great decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage in Phillipians shows us the plan that God has for our life. Paul wrote this message to address some of the false teachers. These false teachers were called dogs because they did not have a pure mind. They were not in Christ. They were telling the people of Phillipi that they were to still make animal sacrifices to God for forgiveness of sins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Paul warns to be aware of dogs and evildoers. These people thought that they can save themselves by their own acts. Which, we know is not true. It is by God’s grace and God’s grace only that we achieve salvation. It is not based on a man’s works (Ephesians 2:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about it. Even if we could earn salvation by our works. Our most holy acts are like dirty rags before a Holy God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;justification&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#justification&quot; aria-label=&quot;justification permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Justification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul mentions he wants to be found in Christ. When he says he wants to be found in Christ. He is referring to his salvation and the act of being declared righteous by a holy God. It is important to remember when God saves us we are declared righteous before Him. Only God can declare us, the believing sinner, righteous based on the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross(Romans 4:25). This process is called justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification is to not be confused with God making us righteousness. That is a work in progress until we eventually meet the Lord. It’s God positionally declaring us as righteous before Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sanctification&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sanctification&quot; aria-label=&quot;sanctification permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sanctification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next phase of salvation is called sanctification.
Sanctification is the process of the Holy Spirit working in us to make us more like Jesus day by day. Jesus loves us and want us to live life more abundantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul’s goal was to know Christ. He didn’t want to just be in him.
He wanted to know him personally. To know him intimately.
He wanted the power of Christ in his life.
He wanted to the power to turn away from sin.
He wanted to know Christ painfully.
He wanted to know what it was like to suffer for the glory of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 12 Paul is indicating that he wants to forget his old self and instead pursue Christ like an athlete pursues a gold medal or trophy (Hebrews 12:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of sanctificaiton to the likeness of running a marathon race. We are running to get to the finish line. In our salvation the finish line is when we get to meet Christ. That is our reward.
We also have the pleasure of having Christ help us the entire race.
It’s like having Jesus waiting for you a you at the end of each lap to enourage and inspire you. He is there giving you some water. Patting you on your back and encouraging you along the entire way. That is what sanctification is like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does God help you through the process of sanctification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible&lt;/strong&gt; - God will help you by teaching you through His word. See John 17:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prayer&lt;/strong&gt; - God will prompt us to pray for help to be more like Jesus. See 1 Timothy 4:4-5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suffering and trials&lt;/strong&gt; - God will sometimes bring trials into our lives because our faith needs to be tried. You can’t trust in a faith that hasn’t been tested. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it great that God wants to help us to be more like Christ. Christ is our savior and we should be hungry to want to be more like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;glorification&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#glorification&quot; aria-label=&quot;glorification permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Glorification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final phase of our salvation. This is when we will go to heaven one day when we will really get to know Christ. How will we get to know Christ? We will get to know Christ because our body will become like Christ. This is when we will recieve our glorified body. See 1 Corinthians 15:53-55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the three stages of salvation. Isn’t salvation such a great gift. Not only is it great but it’s free. A pouring out of God’s heart and the love He has for us. That he gave His only begotten son. So we can be saved! So we can be set free from the penalty of sin. All God asks is that we believe in His beloved Son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through Christ. Do you know Jesus? Do you really know him and have a personal relationship with Him? If not now is the time. The time to get right with Christ. To get free from sin. To become a new creation in Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible says if you hear Jesus knocking its time to let Him into your heart. Now is the time of acceptance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to make that leap of faith. I am very happy for you. That decision will change your life drastically for the good. Now repeat after me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus I know I am a sinner and there is only one way to be forgiven for my sins. It is to put my faith and trust in you. I believe you were born of the virgin Mary and lived a sinless life. That you took my place and died on the cross for my sin. I belive that you ressurected from the dead three days later and that you are exhalted and seated at the right hand of the Father. I want to turn away from my sin and follow you. Please come into my heart and be my Lord. In Jesus Holy name I pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has risen indeed! Those words bring so much joy to a christians’ heart. When Jesus ressurected from the dead He brought so much hope to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ressurection is the basis of the Christian faith. Without the ressurection we have no hope. We have no chance of Heaven. We are forever in bondage to sin. Non believers to this day try to deny the work of the cross and the fact the Jesus rose from the dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage here in Matthew 28 has clear proof that Jesus rose from the dead. It recounts the story of what happend when Mary Magadlene went to the tomb to see the body of Jesus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know Jesus was crucified on Friday and was buried the same day.
So the following day it was a very somber day. People were devastated they thought their savior was truly dead. So you can imagine the suprise Mary was in store for. When she arrived to the tomb she found that the stone was rolled away! The tomb was empty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can think why the stone was moved away. Well it wasn’t for Jesus but it had been moved so Mary and the disciples could come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mary went inside she found there was two angels inside. One was at the foot and one at the head of where Jesus body once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go over what we learn from the angels message. The angels message can be broken into three points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fear-not&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fear-not&quot; aria-label=&quot;fear not permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fear not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to fear because Jesus is alive!!!
Jesus was not there. He was not in the tomb. He had risen like He said He would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the conclusion of what I believe to be the three greatest events in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incarnation&lt;/strong&gt; - Jesus was God in flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crucification&lt;/strong&gt; - Jesus died in subsitution for us. He paid His own body for our sins. So we can be freed from sin’s penalty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ressurection&lt;/strong&gt; - The basis of the Christian fatih. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus told us He would rise. It was written throughout the bible about His ressurection. We know the bible is all true. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tomb was empty. Jesus physically raised from the dead. It wasn’t just a spiritual awakening but it was a physically awakening. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was seen alive for 40 days and 40 nights by His apostles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He helped convert Saul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lives Jesus is changing today. We all have our testimony how Jesus has changed us. We all have become new creations in Christ.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can have His pardon&lt;/strong&gt;. If christ hasn’t risen we are not free from our sins. 1 Corinthians 15:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have His power&lt;/strong&gt;. Ephesians 1:19-20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have His purpsose&lt;/strong&gt;. God give us a purpose. 1 Corinthians 15:19 Life is vanity without God. Our soul is restless without God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have His presence&lt;/strong&gt;. Hebrews 13:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have His pattern&lt;/strong&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have his promise&lt;/strong&gt; - John 14 Jesus will come again for us. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angels told Mary to tell the apostles the good news that Jesus is alive! That Jesus has conquered sin and death. This is what Jesus wanted. For everyone to know the good news. So we just like Mary should go and tell others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we should put our hope in. Telling others about Christ. Giving others the hope that Christ has given you. We can’t put our hope in the government or our jobs. We definitely can’t put our hope in our good works. We don’t go to heaven based on our good works (Ephesians 2:8). There is only one person we can put our hope in and that is Jesus Christ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
&lt;br /&gt; Craig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gracious Father you are our one true living hope. You are our father. A father who we can always put our faith in. We thank you for giving up your only begotten son. Who paid the ultimate price for our sins. Just so we can have a future so we can have a hope of going to heaven one day. Thank you so much Lord. Our prayer is to always remember what you did for us and that we never need to live in fear because of the hope you give us. In the mighty wonderful powerful name of Jesus. We pray!
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;

Most christians when they give their testimony they sometimes spend too much time talking about what God has stopped them from doing. It is okay to say what you no longer do but your focus should be on talking about what you now do in your life because of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-a-child-of-god-should-do&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-a-child-of-god-should-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;what a child of god should do permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What a child of God should do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should purse righteousness in all they do.&lt;/strong&gt; - What does this look like? It means you should always seek to do what is right. Regardless of where you are or who you are with. This holds true when you are out in your neighborhood, at work, or anywhere in public. God is calling us to be good witnesses. We can’t be good witnesses when we don’t see what is right. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 6:33&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should purse Godliness&lt;/strong&gt; - What does this look like? It means you should have a genuine blameless character. A person that is the same person whether they are in public or private. A person that would do the right thing even when nobody is looking. You are simply seeking God. You can’t pursuse Godliness without pursuing the Holy Spirit. In verse 6(1 Timothy 6:6) we are told Godliness with contentment should be our goal. The Lord is all we need!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should pursue faith&lt;/strong&gt; - What does this look like? It starts with having a saving faith. This is the faith you have when you accept Jesus Christ as your savior. Saving faith only take a little faith. It’s the sustaining faith you need. This is the faith you have in God when you are going through major trials in your life. This is the kind of faith Peter had when he stepped out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus (Matthew 14:22-33). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should pursue love in all they do.&lt;/strong&gt; - What does this look like? We should be loving others like we love ourself. We should be loving others like Jesus loves us. How can we love someone. One way is by serving them. Think about Jesus and how he served his apostles on His last day before dying for us(John 13:1-17). He truly set the example for us. What kind of love should we have? The love that only comes from the Holy Spirt. This love is called Agape love. It is a sacrificial love. It is a kind of love that only believers in Christ can show. Finally who shoud we love? We should love everyone. Our neighbors and even our enemies. Jesus still loved Judas even though he had betrayed Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John 13:35&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should pursue patience and endurance&lt;/strong&gt; - What does this look like? This means that we wait on the Lord in all we do. That we understand that God’s will will be done and not ours. That everything happens on God’s timing not ours. So what are we to do? We need to be still and know that I am God(Psalms 46:10). We need to never lose faith and stand strong in any opposition we face. Always remembering that trials make us stronger (Romans 5:1-5). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should pursue meekness&lt;/strong&gt;  - What does this look like? This means we demonstrate power under control. This means we are in control of our flesh. We don’t lose patience. We don’t get easily angered. We become like Jesus. Jesus only mad when God was dishonored (1 Peter 2:21-23). Being meek may be one of the hardest thing to do as a christian. As we need to be in control over our flesh. There is only one way we can do that. We need the help of the Holy Spirit. So make sure to be in good fellowship with God and seeking His help everyday and every minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a fallen world. A world that has turned away from God. A world that lacks hope. This is a time more than ever that we need a revival. This is a time where the world needs more children of God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
&lt;br /&gt; Craig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Prayer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavenly father we want to thank you that you have given us the opportunity to be children of God. We have this thanks to Jesus! Jesus payed the ultimate sacrifice for us when He died on the cross for us. Jesus paid a debt He didn’t owe and we are forever grateful for the work of the cross. We know you saved us for a reason and that reason is for us to do good works, to spread your gospel and be the salt and light for the world. Lord help to encourage us day by day to walk in the spirit in all we do. Our prayer is for your Holy Spirit to pour into us and your word to pour out of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mighty powerful wonderful name of Jesus.
Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes we connect his grace only with salvation. However, His grace is much deeper than salvation only. God’s grace can sustain us through any storm in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite passages of scripture. Paul wrote this letter to the people of Corinth. He wrote this letter to address the false teachers that were questioning his authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He broke his message into two sections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-boasts-about-his-vision-of-paradise-v1-6&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#paul-boasts-about-his-vision-of-paradise-v1-6&quot; aria-label=&quot;paul boasts about his vision of paradise v1 6 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul boasts about his vision of paradise. v1-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to defened himself Paul had to boast about himself. Paul was a great man of integrity. A very humbled man. That truly defined what it is like to deny yourself and take up your cross. Boasting for him went against all his beliefs. It was the last thing he  wanted to do. However, in this scenario he didn’t have a choice. So what did he do? He boasted about his weakness instead. He boasted humbly. As he didn’t want the spotlight on him. This is why he said I know a man in Christ in verse 12 (2 Corinthians 12:2). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you had a vison of heaven. You would most likely be running to everyone you know to tell them about it. In this day of time there are many people that claimed they went to heaven and came back. One thing to question are they really telling the truth or just looking to put the spotlight on them. Paul was the complete opposite. He always wanted the spotlight on Christ and he did that by not boasting about his vision of heaven until it was needed as a defense against the false teachers in Corinth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pauls-painful-experience-v-7-10&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#pauls-painful-experience-v-7-10&quot; aria-label=&quot;pauls painful experience v 7 10 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul’s painful experience v 7-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul had a thorn in his flesh. Many people have done a lot of studies about what Paul could have meant by the thorn? The bible does not tell us. SO every study done are just speculations on what it could have been. Since he said his flesh some beieve it ha something to do with his body. It could have been an earache, headache, eye trouble etc. Other’s believe that his thorn could have been a reference to the fallen nature of the world and maybe it was a temptation. Your guess is as good as mine. We do know that it was a trial in his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul responded to this trial in three ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He prayed&lt;/strong&gt; - when a time of difficulty comes we should turn to God in prayer. How should we pray? We can pray like Paul did asking God to take away his thorn. To take away his suffering. Or we can pray for help through that thorn. In that sense we are praying for God’s will to be done not ours. When we pray for God’s will to be done the main thing should seek from God is discernment(James 1:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He acknowledged that the thorn was allowed by God&lt;/strong&gt; - Paul says in verse 7 that the thorn in his flesh was given to him by God. So Paul accepted that this was in God’s will for him. So when you have a trial in life think about it like Paul’s thorn. What does God wants you to learn from this thorn? In Paul’s situation it was to keep him from becoming proud. It was also preventive to keep him from sinnning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He focused on the spiritual gain&lt;/strong&gt; -
What was the spirtual blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thorn forced Paul to keep turning to prayer. Which, brought him closer to God. Key thing to remember is that God’s want us on our knees (2 Chronicles 7:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It kept Paul humble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allowed God to use him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It taught Paul that God’s grace is sufficient. We are not only saved by God’s grace but we are also sustained by Gods grace. It’s by God’s sustaining grace that we get through any trial in life. How do we allow God’s sustaining grace to work in our lifes? We need to be weak. It’s when we are weak. God’s strength is made perfect. Remember this always. It is okay to be weak. Right now our nation feel weaks. There is not much we can do to stop the coronavirus. It is all in God’s control and that is when His true glory and grace can shine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
&lt;br /&gt; Craig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lord we thank you for this amazing scripture. Help us to be like Paul and remember that you are with us through any trial in life. Help us to be humble and turn to you. Help us to acknowledge that it is your will we want done in our lifes and not us. You want to use us and we can make that happen by believing in Christ and always turning to you in prayer. In the mighty powerful name of Jesus. 
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is normal to have these feelings.
As we can’t do anything on our own about it. We need God. God is our refuge and strength.So remember that and don’t let your heart be troubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing passage of scripture.
Lets think about the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens right after Jesus had finished washing all His disciples feet.
He had just told his disciples that one of His apostles would betray Him.
Naturally all the apostles were worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that Jesus also just told them that He would only be with them a little longer. Why was this? This was because Jesus was going to go to Heaven to be with the Father and that apostles couldn’t immediatley follow Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter responded by saying “Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.”That was when Jesus said that Peter would deny Him three times before Jesus left them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind Peter was their leader. If peter would deny Christ what would the other apostles do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles clearly needed encouragement.That is why Jesus responded with this glorious passage. He didn’t want their hearts to be troubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds us we have a home in Heaven. This is our real home and we will go there one day. This current world we live is in temporary. So don’t be so bothered on what is going on this world. Instead keep your eyes and mind fixed on heaven and we could overcome our troubles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a promise from God that He will come back and recieve us.
What did Jesus promise? He promised that He will come back for His people. The Church. This is a direct reference to the rapture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that no man comes to the Father but through me. What did He mean by that? This is great essential doctrine. That the only way to heaven is through Jesus. You must put your trust in Jesus as your savior. He died for your sins.
So that you can have a life in Heaven with Him. How great is that!
Jesus is the way, the truth and the the life. Oh how glorious that statement is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
&lt;br /&gt; Craig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lord we thank you for this beautiful promise you give us.
Not just this promise but the many promises you give us.
You give us so much hope and a clear blueprint on why we should not let our hearts to be troubled.
Help us to remember this everyday and to put it into practice.
It&apos;s in the Holy mighty name of Jesus that we pray.
&lt;p&gt;Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joy comes from inward things when you have rest in your soul.
Joy comes from having one mind. A mind that is like Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote this letter to the people of Phillipi because there was division among the people. Paul wanted them and us to have unity. The way to unity is to live in humility. Verse 5 is the key to this scripture.
Jesus Christ set the example for us (Phillipians 2:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have unity we need to have love(v2), humility(v3) and put others first(v4).
Consider yourself equal with everyone else. Remember we all for short of the glory of God(Romans 3:23).
What does it mean to be humbled? It doesn’t mean not to care about yourself or think any lower about yourself. It simply means to put others first. To think about their needs. How can you serve them. Mark 10:45 and Luke 22:27. You can never be too humble. If you think you are humble. You are not. Humble has no pride at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;paul-pleads-with-us-for-humility&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#paul-pleads-with-us-for-humility&quot; aria-label=&quot;paul pleads with us for humility permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul pleads with us for humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 1-4 paul pleads with us to be humble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;paul-gives-the-pattern-of-humility&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#paul-gives-the-pattern-of-humility&quot; aria-label=&quot;paul gives the pattern of humility permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul gives the pattern of humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ set the pattern for us. He completely humbled himself for us.
This is why We need to have the same mindset of Jesus to humble ourselves for others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 6 Paul points out that Jesus is God. That Jesus is soverign and that Jesus was God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 7 Paul tells us how Jesus went from a soverign God to a humble servant just for us.
He emptied Himself. He laid aside His majesty and took on humanity/humility. He took off his Crown and became a peasant. He did this voluntarily and for us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 8 Pauls tell us that Christ humbled himself for us. He gave himself up for us. He died and sacrificied Himself for us. Why did Jesus die on the cross for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give us Salvation(John 3:16). By his death we were given the opportunity to be rescued from the penalty of sin(Romans 6:23).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He died on the cross so he can defeat sin and Satan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He died so the love of God could be revealed to us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;paul-reveals-the-power-for-humility&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#paul-reveals-the-power-for-humility&quot; aria-label=&quot;paul reveals the power for humility permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul reveals the power for humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Finally in verse 12 Paul concludes to say that we need to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. What did Paul mean by this? He was simply saying we need to go out and live our salvation. It doesn’t mean we are to work for our salvation. Remember we can never earn our salvation. It is a free gift given to us(Ephesians 2:8). It means we are working for the good of the church because of our salvation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  We are to let God work in us(v13). Our goal is to be like Jesus through sanctification. God uses trials to help and shape us to be more like Jesus. So when trials come your way. Don’t pray to God to be delivered from that trial. Instead pray for revelation on what God wants you to learn from that trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  We need to shine (v14:16) - It is our duties as children of God to be a good witness. We should always show joy to others and not to complain. When we shine our light we will be given opportunities to tell us others about Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Why should we shine our light? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  So we can rejoice in the day of Christ. One day we will be caught up in the air to meet Jesus Christ. What a glorious day that will be. To think one day we will sit in the reward seat of Christ too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  This is what Paul focused on. He had a heavenly mindset and knew the race he was running was not in vain. That all his labor was not for nothing. He knew one day he would hear “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:23). Wouldn’t that bring you so much joy? It sure brings me joy just to think about when that day comes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord we just want to thank you that we can remain joyous through any circumstance in life. Lord you set the example for us on how to live.
My prayer is that we can be of one mind, united in all we do and that we will be inspired that our work for your kingdom is never in vain!
In the wonderful and powerful name of Jesus I pray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
Craig&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joy in any Circumstance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sometimes it may be hard to remain joyous under intense situations like what we are going through with the Corona Virus.

However, it’s important to remember that God is in control. The passage here in Philippians 1 give us the blueprint on how to remain joyous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillipians 1 we know was written by Paul while he was in prison (Philippians 1:13-14). Paul loved the Phillipians and he wrote this message to encourage his fellow believers. Paul was very thankful to have fellowship with the people of Phillipi. &lt;/p&gt;

Fellowship in the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Despite what is going on we have fellowship with others. We may be limited to our homes right now but we have many means to stay in fellowship with others via social media. It’s times like this were we should be eager to fellowship more. &lt;/p&gt;

Opportunities to spread the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  His current circumstances gave opportunity to further the spread of the gospel even more. Paul was placed in jail, shipwrecked and even bit by a snake. Paul didn’t let that stop him from his goal of having Christ preached. Instead of being overwhelmed by his trials he used it as platform to further the gospel. Paul had the mindset that no matter what happens in life He was still going to preach Christ. So yes Paul was able to rejoice even in extreme circumstances and so can we if keep that mindset!&lt;/p&gt;

Christ will be magnified through Him&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  We want Christ to be magnified in all we do. When we rejoice, which is the theme of the book Phillipians, under any circumstance like Paul did we allow others to see Christ through us. This should motivate us to remain joyous and to bear fruit so we can be good witnesses to all. We are here for a purpose and we should keep that in mind in these hard times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do remain joyful? Prayer is so important. We need to be praying to God for help and praying for our fellow believers. Which is exactly what Paul did for his fellow brothers and sistes in Christ in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Paul pray for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He prayed that the believers would have an abounding love in verse 9. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He prayed that the believers would have a discerning approval of execellent things. Priortizing what is most valuable and most important. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He prayed that his fellow believers would have a genuine and blameless character. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He prayed that his fellow believers would bear fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was convinced everything that happened to him was part of Gods will so he was able to remain joyous. As long as others can see Christ in you. You are bearing fruit. To bear fruit furthers the kingdom and this will bring you joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has begun the good work in us and He will complete it. We were justified and now we are being sanctified. Finally we will be glorified one day when we are in Heaven with Jesus. That is why we can rejoice when Paul says to live is Christ and to die is gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly we have the opporunity to share and defend the gospel through any circumstance in life when we keep the same mindset Paul had. God bless you all and Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brother in Christ,
Craig&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to my site]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello guest!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello guest and welcome to my site.
My mission is simple. To spread the good news about Jesus Christ. It is our role as Christians and children of God. God has been putting it on my heart to use my technical skills to help further his kingdom. So I have gone and put together this site to proclaim the goodness of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a completely new experience for me so I welcome your feedback. I will be adding new features over time. With the end goal being the same. My hope is to share the good news of Christ and to help plant the seed in any unbeliever’s heart. while at the same time helping to edify my current brothers and sisters in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My site will consist of mostly devotionals from sermons I hear at my church and other sources like the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about myself and my testimony you can visit my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thevictoryisyours.com/pages/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;about me&lt;/a&gt; page.

&lt;p&gt;We are going through challenging times right now with the Corona Virus.  Now is the time to be the light of the world.
It is our duty as christians to bring hope to the world!(Matthew 5:14-16). &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three years in Christ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Three years it has been!

  &lt;img src=&quot;/media/inchrist2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years it has been! Three years I have been set free. Three years I am no longer a slave to sin. Three glorious years it has been. Three years I have been blessed by God’s overflowing mercy and grace when He saved a sinner like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t seem to stop thinking about how blessed I am. To be justified before a Holy God. To have the gift of the Holy Spirit helping me everyday. To be able to meet my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ one day. I get giddy just thinking about it. Yes there has been many highs but there has also been many trials. I would be lying if I told you that life has been a breeze for me the past three years. In the last year I found out my daughter was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and my mom with Alzheimier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving that kind of news can cripple someone. However, God didn’t let that happen to me. He didn’t give us a spirt of fear but a spirit of power and of a sound mind. That is why I am so grateful to be a child of God. Without the help of the Holy Spirit. I really would have been lost navigating through the difficult times. He has been there everyday for us. From counseling and encouraging us through every single therapy session for Avery to making tough decisions such as pulling my mother out of her home and moving her into a care facility. I know one thing for sure God has never let me down and no words can ever describe the feeling of being a child of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to do when life falls apart]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Corona Virus has caused many to fear.

The Corona Virus has caused many to fear. Some to question if the world is really falling apart. Do you feel this way? How do you respond? Some will turn to social media. Which, could cause you to panic. Some may turn to drugs. Some may turn to alcohol. Some may even consider suicide. What should we really do? Turn to God.

&lt;p&gt;Why should we run to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our refuge. Jeremiah 16:19 and Psalm 46:1. When we turn to God we have His protection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our strength. Proverbs 18:10. When we turn to God He give us strength to overcome anything in life. Phillipians 4:13 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our help. When you believe in God you receieve the Holy Spirit who is your helper (Acts 2:38). The Holy Spirit is the best help we can recieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God takes away our fear. God is always with us so no need to fear. Deuteronomy 31:8 and Jeremiah 1:8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be thirsty for what the Lord has to offer (John 4:13-14). We can think of Jesus like a river. He is overflowing and His love is never ending. He is the living water and if we drink of Him we will no longer be thirsty for things in our flesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive joy. Psalm 46:4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive stability. Psalm 46:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive help from the Holy Spirit. Psalm 46:5 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord has a plan for you. So its best to be patient and trust in His plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psalm 46:8 we are told that the Lord ceases wars. This could be prothetic to His second coming. When Jesus will put and end to the great tribulation. What this shows is that God really cares for you. So cast your cares on Him and He will give you rest(Matthew 11:28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants you to not just tell him about your problems but to also leave them with Him. Simply lay your problems at the feet of God. When you let God take care of your problems. It will build up your faith and testimony and most importantly God’s glory can shine through anything. Yes God is bigger than the Corona Virus. We will overcome this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the most important part is that we can’t run to God unless He is our savior. Do you know Christ personally? Is He your Lord and Savior? If not now is the time(Revelation 3:20) to know Him and trust Him as your Lord.

We should not walk in the counsel of the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who are the wicked? They are the unbelievers. They are the atheists. They are people who don’t seek God. They are sinners who rebel against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember we all are sinners and we all for short of the glory of God. We need God’s help to not sin. The Holy Spirit works to convict us of sin day by day through the process of sanctification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin usually starts small. It usually starts with us walking in Sin. Then next we know we are standing in it. Which, leads to us sitting in sin. We can’t forget the progression of sin. James 1:14-15 tell us &lt;blockquote&gt;14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin leads to sadness while holiness leads to happiness. This is why we should be saturated in God’s word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Bible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delight in the Word or God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate day and night on the Bible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should obey the word of God - James 1:22-25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does mediation mean? Means to empty your mind. If you ever visit Israel you may see the Jewish people muttering words non stop. They are in turn actually meditating on God’s word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is hard thing to do for some people. When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust begins with being a believer. Do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you do that means you have already put your faith in Jesus Christ. So you have established a relationship of trust in Him as your lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is to keep that trust in all seasons of your life. In life you will go through many trials. However, be of good cheer because your Lord has conquered the world. (John 16:33)  Trials come into our life to build up our faith and trust. Trials bring you closer to God. How do you become closer? It starts by trusting in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a plan for you. He has promised this to us in Jeremiah 29:11. He has great plans for us. For us to have a future with Him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it sometimes its hard to have trust when you can’t see every step of the way. However, always remember as a fellow Christian. We walk by faith(2 Corinthians 5:7) and not by sight. Walking by faith requires us to be praying constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17-18). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let our prayers be known to God. Do not worry about anything. Instead pray about everything and make your requests be known to God (Philippians 4:6). The peace of God surpasses all understanding and will guard your heart and mind. So relax and don’t worry and let God control. This is His will for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes you can choose happiness. Happiness is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are some people just not happy? Well once reason is as a world we have a tendency to focus on the things we don’t have. Instead we should be grateful for the things we do have. Remember everything good in your life comes from God (James 1:17). So it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a different will for all of us so its up to Him how and when He blesses us. Again happiness comes down to perspective. Once you change your perspective you will see how blessed you really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally remember it’s always best to be humble. God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.                           &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We can have Victory with Jesus Christ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The passage of Matthew 4 is one of the greatest inspirational messages.

It’s a clear example of how we can overcome any trial in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we do this? The easiest answer is to keep your eyes on Jesus. Think about what happend to Peter when he took his eyes off Jesus. The minute he started to look at the waves he began to drown. This is a classic example of what happens when we take our eyes off Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said &lt;blockquote&gt;
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you [f]will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” - John 16:33 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most important thing to remember. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Chrsit overame sin and death!! There is nothing Jesus can’t overcome and we have Jesus on our side. How great is that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage of scripture Jesus sets the exmaple on how to deal with temptation. Jesus is tempted three times by Satan in the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jesus respond? He responds by using the Sword of the Spirit. This is the most important weapon we need to defeat the enemy. It is our offensive and our defense as well. When we use the Sword of the Spirit we don’t feel victim to the lifes of the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its very important to remember our enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour(1 Peter 5:8). He is very manipulative. That is why it’s so important to know the word of God. Look at how in verse 6 Satan actually tried to twist the truth and use it against Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus responded and said it is written you should not temp the Lord your God. By knowing and using the Word of God as a weapon. The enemy can’t condemn us because we have the truth. The Word of God! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what it says in Romans 8:1.
&lt;q&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remember this we can and will have victory over the enemey and just about anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
