&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like things are not going in your favor and everything is going wrong for you? How do you respond? Some may turn to drugs. Some may turn to alcohol. Some may even consider suicide. What should we really do? The answer is God. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we run to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our refuge. Jeremiah 16:19 and Psalm 46:1. When we turn God we have protection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our strength. Proverbs 18:10. When we turn to God He give us strength. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our help. When you believe in God you receieve the Holy Spirit who is your helper. Acts 2:38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God takes away our fear. God is always with us so no need to fear. Deuteronomy 31:8  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be thirsty for what the Lord has to offer (John 4:13-14). We can think of Jesus like a river. He has the living water J
When we drink from the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive joy. Psalm 46:4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive stability. Psalm 46:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive help from the Holy Spirit. Psalm 46:5 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord has a plan for you so be patient and trust in His plan.
In psalm 46:8 we are told that the Lord ceases wars. This could be prothetic to His second coming. When Jesus will put and end to the great tribulation. What this shows is that God really cares for you. So cast your cares on Him and He will give you rest(Matthew 11:28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants you to not just tell him about your problems but to also leave them with Him. Simply lay your problems at the feet of God. So let God take care of your problems and He will be exalted high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the most important part is that we can’t run to God unless He is our savior. Do you know Christ personally? Is He your Lord and Savior? If not now is the time(Revelation 3:20) to know Him and trust Him as your Lord.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Characters of a blessed man]]></title><description><![CDATA[Psalm 1 is a great passage that shows the difference of a Godly walk vs a non Godly walk]]></description><link>https://craig-joseph-lucas.github.io/the-victory-is-yours//posts/characters-of-a-blessed-man</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://craig-joseph-lucas.github.io/the-victory-is-yours//posts/characters-of-a-blessed-man</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We need to be separate from the world but not isolated from the world. We should not walk in the counsel of the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the wicked? They are the unbelievers. They are the atheists. They are people who don’t seek God. They are sinners who rebel against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we all are sinners and we all for short of the glory of God. We need God’s help to not sin. The Holy Spirit works to convict us of sin day by day through the process of sanctification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin usually starts small. Usually starts with us walking in Sin. Then next we know we are standing in it. The last thing we want is to be sitting in sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin leads to sadness. Holiness leads to happiness. This is why we should besaturated in God’s word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Bible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delight in the Word or God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate day and night on the Bible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should obey the word of God - James 1:22-25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does mediation mean? Means to empty your mind. The jewish in Israel they mutter the words non stop.&lt;/p&gt;

God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?]]></description><link>https://craig-joseph-lucas.github.io/the-victory-is-yours//posts/trusting-god-and-not-worrying</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://craig-joseph-lucas.github.io/the-victory-is-yours//posts/trusting-god-and-not-worrying</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trust is hard thing to do for some people. When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust begins with being a believer. Do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you do that means you have already put your faith into Jesus Christ. So you have established a relationship of trust in Him as your lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is to keep that trust in all seasons of your life. In life you will go through many trials. However, be of good cheer because your Lord has conquered the world. (John 16:33)  Trials come into your life to build up your faith and trust. Trials bring you closer to God. How do you become closer? It starts by trusting in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a plan for you. He has promised this to us in Jeremiah 29:11. He has plans for us. For us to have a future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it sometimes its hard to have trust when you can’t see every step of the way. However, always remember. We walk by faith(2 Corinthians 5:7) and not by sight. So what can we do? We need to pray constantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let our prayers be known to God. Do not worry about anything. Instead pray about everything and make your requests be known to God (Philippians 4:6). The peace of God surpasses all understanding and will guard your heart and mind. So relax and don’t worry and let God control. This is His will for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why it's Good to be Content]]></title><description><![CDATA[The passage of Matthew 4 is one of the greatest inspirational messages.

Yes you can choose happiness. Happiness is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is one of the biggest reasons of being happy? It’s when we focus on what we don’t have. Instead of being grateful for the things you do have. Remember everything good in your life comes from God. It’s up to God how and when he blesses us. So once you change your perspective you will see how blessed you really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally remember it’s always best to be humble. God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.                           &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We can have Victory with Jesus Christ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The passage of Matthew 4 is one of the greatest inspirational messages.

It’s a clear example of how we can overcome any trial in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we do this? My easiest answer is to keep your eyes on Jesus. Think about what happend to Peter when he took his eyes off Jesus. The minute he started to look at the waves he began to drown. This is a classic example of what happens when we take our eyes off Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said &lt;blockquote&gt;
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you [f]will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” - John 16:33 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most important thing to remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Chrsit overame sin and death. There is nothing Jesus can’t overcome and we have Jesus on our side. How great is that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage of scripture Jesus sets the exmaple on how to deal with temptation. Jesus is tempted three times by Satan in the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jesus responds? He responds by using the Sword of the Spirit. This is the only weapon we need to defeat the enemy. It is our offensive and our defense as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour(1 Peter 5:8). He is very manipulative. That is why it’s so important to know the word of God. Look at how in verse 6 Satan actually tried to twist the truth and use it against Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus responded and said it is written you should not temp the Lord your God. By knowing and using the Word of God as a weapon. The enemy can’t condemn us because we have the truth. The Word of God! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what it says in Romans 8:1.
&lt;q&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
