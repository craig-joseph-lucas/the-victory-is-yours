&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello guest and welcome to my site.
My mission is simple. To spread the good news about Jesus Christ. It is our role as Christians and children of God. God has been putting it on my heart to use my technical skills to help further his kingdom. So I have gone and put together this site to proclaim the goodness of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a completely new experience for me so I welcome your feedback. I will be adding new features over time. With the end goal being the same. My hope is to share the good news of Christ and to help plant the seed in any unbeliever’s heart. while at the same time helping to edify my current brothers and sisters in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My site will consist of mostly devotionals from sermons I hear at my church and other sources like the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about myself and my testimony you can visit my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thevictoryisyours.com/pages/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;about me&lt;/a&gt; page. As far as my beliefs you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://thevictoryisyours.com/pages/my-beliefs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;my belief’s page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going through challenging times right now with the Corona Virus.  Now is the time to be the light of the world.
It is our duty as christians to bring hope to the world!(Matthew 5:14-16). &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three years in Christ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Three years it has been!

  &lt;img src=&quot;/media/inchrist2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years it has been! Three years I have been set free. Three years I am no longer a slave to sin. Three glorious years it has been. Three years I have been blessed by God’s overflowing mercy and grace when He saved a sinner like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t seem to stop thinking about how blessed I am. To be justified before a Holy God. To have the gift of the Holy Spirit helping me everyday. To be able to meet my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ one day. I get giddy just thinking about it. Yes there has been many highs but there has also been many trials. I would be lying if I told you that life has been a breeze for me the past three years. In the last year I found out my daughter was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and my mom with Alzheimier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving that kind of news can cripple someone. However, God didn’t let that happen to me. He didn’t give us a spirt of fear but a spirit of power and of a sound mind. That is why I am so grateful to be a child of God. Without the help of the Holy Spirit. I really would have been lost navigating through the difficult times. He has been there everyday for us. From counseling and encouraging us through every single therapy session for Avery to making tough decisions such as pulling my mother out of her home and moving her into a care facility. I know one thing for sure God has never let me down and no words can ever describe the feeling of being a child of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to do when life falls apart]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Corona Virus has caused many to fear.

&lt;p&gt;Why should we run to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our refuge. Jeremiah 16:19 and Psalm 46:1. When we turn to God we have His protection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our strength. Proverbs 18:10. When we turn to God He give us strength to overcome anything in life. Phillipians 4:13 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is our help. When you believe in God you receieve the Holy Spirit who is your helper (Acts 2:38). The Holy Spirit is the best help we can recieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God takes away our fear. God is always with us so no need to fear. Deuteronomy 31:8 and Jeremiah 1:8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;drink-of-the-lord&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#drink-of-the-lord&quot; aria-label=&quot;drink of the lord permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Drink of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be thirsty for what the Lord has to offer (John 4:13-14). We can think of Jesus like a river. He is overflowing and His love is never ending. He is the living water and if we drink of Him we will no longer be thirsty for things in our flesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive joy. Psalm 46:4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive stability. Psalm 46:5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We receive help from the Holy Spirit. Psalm 46:5 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord has a plan for you. So its best to be patient and trust in His plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psalm 46:8 we are told that the Lord ceases wars. This could be prothetic to His second coming. When Jesus will put and end to the great tribulation. What this shows is that God really cares for you. So cast your cares on Him and He will give you rest(Matthew 11:28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants you to not just tell him about your problems but to also leave them with Him. Simply lay your problems at the feet of God. When you let God take care of your problems. It will build up your faith and testimony and most importantly God’s glory can shine through anything. Yes God is bigger than the Corona Virus. We will overcome this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the most important part is that we can’t run to God unless He is our savior. Do you know Christ personally? Is He your Lord and Savior? If not now is the time(Revelation 3:20) to know Him and trust Him as your Lord. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Godly walk]]></title><description><![CDATA[Psalm 1 is a great passage that shows the difference of a Godly walk vs a non Godly walk]]></description><link>https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/the-godly-walk</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/the-godly-walk</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We need to be separate from the world but not isolated from the world. We should not walk in the counsel of the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the wicked? They are the unbelievers. They are the atheists. They are people who don’t seek God. They are sinners who rebel against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we all are sinners and we all for short of the glory of God. We need God’s help to not sin. The Holy Spirit works to convict us of sin day by day through the process of sanctification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin usually starts small. It usually starts with us walking in Sin. Then next we know we are standing in it. Which, leads to us sitting in sin. We can’t forget the progression of sin. James 1:14-15 tell us &lt;blockquote&gt;14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin leads to sadness while holiness leads to happiness. This is why we should be saturated in God’s word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Bible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delight in the Word or God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate day and night on the Bible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should obey the word of God - James 1:22-25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does mediation mean? Means to empty your mind. If you ever visit Israel you may see the Jewish people muttering words non stop. They are in turn actually meditating on God’s word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We become like a tree. We have a purpose. We were planted by God. We will bear fruit through any season in life. We should prosper in all we do. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trust God and Don't worry]]></title><description><![CDATA[Trust is a hard thing to do for some people. When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?]]></description><link>https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/trusting-god-and-not-worrying</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://thevictoryisyours.com//posts/trusting-god-and-not-worrying</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trust is hard thing to do for some people. When you worry you are not trusting God. God loves you and wants you to trust in him. Will you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust begins with being a believer. Do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you do that means you have already put your faith in Jesus Christ. So you have established a relationship of trust in Him as your lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is to keep that trust in all seasons of your life. In life you will go through many trials. However, be of good cheer because your Lord has conquered the world. (John 16:33)  Trials come into our life to build up our faith and trust. Trials bring you closer to God. How do you become closer? It starts by trusting in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a plan for you. He has promised this to us in Jeremiah 29:11. He has great plans for us. For us to have a future with Him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it sometimes its hard to have trust when you can’t see every step of the way. However, always remember as a fellow Christian. We walk by faith(2 Corinthians 5:7) and not by sight. Walking by faith requires us to be praying constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17-18). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let our prayers be known to God. Do not worry about anything. Instead pray about everything and make your requests be known to God (Philippians 4:6). The peace of God surpasses all understanding and will guard your heart and mind. So relax and don’t worry and let God control. This is His will for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happiness is a Choice]]></title><description><![CDATA[Would you believe me if I told you that happiness is a choice?

Yes you can choose happiness. Happiness is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are some people just not happy? Well once reason is as a world we have a tendency to focus on the things we don’t have. Instead we should be grateful for the things we do have. Remember everything good in your life comes from God (James 1:17). So it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has a different will for all of us so its up to Him how and when He blesses us. Again happiness comes down to perspective. Once you change your perspective you will see how blessed you really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally remember it’s always best to be humble. God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.                           &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We can have Victory with Jesus Christ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The passage of Matthew 4 is one of the greatest inspirational messages.

It’s a clear example of how we can overcome any trial in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we do this? The easiest answer is to keep your eyes on Jesus. Think about what happend to Peter when he took his eyes off Jesus. The minute he started to look at the waves he began to drown. This is a classic example of what happens when we take our eyes off Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said &lt;blockquote&gt;
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you [f]will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” - John 16:33 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most important thing to remember. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Chrsit overame sin and death!! There is nothing Jesus can’t overcome and we have Jesus on our side. How great is that!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage of scripture Jesus sets the exmaple on how to deal with temptation. Jesus is tempted three times by Satan in the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jesus respond? He responds by using the Sword of the Spirit. This is the most important weapon we need to defeat the enemy. It is our offensive and our defense as well. When we use the Sword of the Spirit we don’t feel victim to the lifes of the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its very important to remember our enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour(1 Peter 5:8). He is very manipulative. That is why it’s so important to know the word of God. Look at how in verse 6 Satan actually tried to twist the truth and use it against Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus responded and said it is written you should not temp the Lord your God. By knowing and using the Word of God as a weapon. The enemy can’t condemn us because we have the truth. The Word of God! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what it says in Romans 8:1.
&lt;q&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remember this we can and will have victory over the enemey and just about anything else. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
